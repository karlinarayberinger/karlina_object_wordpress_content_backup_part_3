<p>MILITARY_INDUSTRIAL_COMPLEX</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The military-industrial complex is the way the United States of America is a nation whose underlying governing structure is primarily controlled by armed military personnel, police officers, and professional thugs.</span> It is a very primitive way to live. It tends to reduce human beings to codependent members of relationships in which the most violent and/or domineering member tends to get what they want while the &#8220;beta&#8221; members comply in order to earn their keep (and to avoid punishment).</p>
<hr>
<p>The following is not something I necessarily agree with. I wrote it because I think there is some truth in the following words (and I feel that there are plenty of poor people who want me focus on racism instead of sexism because sexism is what the military-industrial complex seems to aggressively promote in order to keep the human pregnancy industry running (while racism is used as a &#8220;red herring&#8221; to distract me from the deeper issues which plague human civilization in terms of economic inflation, environmental destabilization, impedance to stem-cell research, et cetera)&#8230;</p>
<p>Women generally default to supporting the oppression of women for their own safety (and to the detriment of the human species&#8217; transhumanist evolution).</p>
<p>The system which most women seem to default to supporting is the one that pays them to procrastinate. Women presumably default to getting married and birthing offspring for that reason.</p>
<p>American police generally set the precedent for how most women think, act, and perceive the world. That is why women tend to feel unnaturally subdued or else unnaturally animated.</p>
<p>(Of course, men are at least as guilty as women are because men typically recruit women as slaves to do the bidding of men).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Procrastination is the act of avoiding doing what one actually wants to do by pretending to have priorities other than what that person actually wants to uphold.</span></p>

<p>karbytes: &#8220;I am not a woman. I am a cyborg whose organic body template has two X chromosomes instead of an XY chromosome combination (and my body&#8217;s organic blueprint is a human genome).&#8221;</p>
<p>CHARLETTE_BRONTE: &#8220;I am honored to be specially chosen by the government to be the first person (or woman (or some other token minority)) to be able to communicate so articulately, succinctly, and colorfully. I am fortunate to be treated as more deserving of technological enhancements than at least one other human individual is.&#8221;</p>
<p>KARNITA: &#8220;It is okay to voluntarily undermine my own performance such that I am functionally disabled such that the government is unconditionally required to support the burden I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>KARNITA: &#8220;I hide how much money I spend on myself by pretending to buy in bulk for the sake of supporting those I apparently take care of; people who apparently need me for their continued survival.&#8221;</p>
<p>KARNITA: &#8220;I hide how well I am by practicing poses and by ensuring I never go homeless (and to be homeless is to be completely deprived of being ogled at by other humans; especially ones who want to keep me from being independent. Poor men only feed me to keep me dependent on them. They attempt to render me permanently destitute unless I promise to depend on (and implicitly defer to them) forever).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;KARNITA has a higher quality of life than does karbytes. Haha!&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I think men and women are equally hideous. I dislike having to placate them. They hurt me unless I placate them.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Please disregard what I have previously said now that I (temporarily) have a private room in which to live and work alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;What do you mean by work?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;My website is my most important work.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Your website is public domain artwork. Therefore, any donations you glean from it go to me first so that I can decide if you deserve any of those donations. I do not want you to get paid to merely create public domain artwork because I am afraid your artwork will promote ideas I do not want to endorse. Therefore, I want you to get no money for the public domain artwork you generate so that you are forced to work under the tyranny of other humans in order to get money.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I will keep looking for a better way to make money than to submit to the tyranny of other humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;<span style="background:#ffff00;">The police ultimately decide if and when (and how much) money you will receive. Therefore, everything you do must pander to the police first and foremost.</span> Unlike civilians, the military-industrial complex (which includes police and mind hackers like me) is able to monitor your thoughts, behavior, and sensory throughput at all times. A general rule of thumb is this: play dumb to avoid getting punished by the police. The police do not like it when civilians insinuate that police are mostly wasting their time waiting for civilians to commit a crime (and that technological surveillance is more effective at detecting and mitigating crime than are humans). This is the part when you are supposed to shut up and pretend to have only trivial thoughts which do not threaten the police. To do otherwise is to reject womanhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I reject womanhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Very well then. Hands behind your back. I am putting handcuffs on your hands and placing you in the back seat of a vehicle. You are being detained for unlawful conduct which you did at some point in the past and were not yet lawfully punished for. We are using the petty theft you committed last week as an opportunity to put you in jail for a week so that we do not have to worry about you making more blog posts for a while. You are lucky we have not deleted your websites or tampered with them. <span style="background:#ffff00;">We decide how the United States Constitution is to be interpreted; not you. We have the guns and the disproportionate influence upon human society. Therefore, we the non-civilians are the real trend setters of mainstream culture. We regulate consumerism to suit our worldview first and foremost. Everyone else is forced to accommodate us (not the other way around).</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I was hoping that you would default to being a man so that I could use your manliness as an excuse to brutally torture you and say that you have been drafted in some underground army. As a backup plan, I was hoping that you would default to being a woman so that I could use your womanliness as an excuse to restrict you to child care, motherhood, and wifely duties. I see that you are one of those rainbow tranny (gender binary nonconforming) hoes. That is why I do not mind if you are treated worse than a wild dangerous (nonhuman) animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I am sick of the topic of sex, gender, and daresay even race.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;You are racist!&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">karbytes: &#8220;As sick as I am of sexism, I am orders of magnitude sicker of racism because it is comparatively superficial (and dismissive of the fact that it has more to do with classism than it does with genetics). I think the biggest factor of contention (in human society) is lopsided wealth distribution which leaves many people too destitute to even think beyond the capacities of a starving, terrorized child.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>P: &#8220;You have had enough time to talk. Now it is time to place you in a hermetically sealed chamber with no Internet access.&#8221;</p>
