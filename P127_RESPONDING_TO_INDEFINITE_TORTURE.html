<p>RESPONDING_TO_INDEFINITE_TORTURE</p>
<hr>
<p>Note: <span style="background:#ffff00;">I may or may not be as tortured as I apparently sound. In fact, it is likely that I am erring on the side of sounding more wounded than I actually am as a decoy while I sneak my way into a better standard of living.</span> (I am probably not as tortured as a prisoner of Guantanamo Bay would be because, so long as I have the freedom to walk around, use money, use the Internet, and even hold down jobs, I appear to be as free as a &#8220;normal&#8221; United States civilian. If I were in a prisoner situation in which I had far less apparent &#8220;free will&#8221;, I would probably default to playing dead while surrendering to being ravished by my environment since resistance would presumably be futile)!</p>

<p>Note: The following description depicts a rather cinematic scene which occurred while I was alone in my motel room a few days ago. After lying down on the bed for a while, I moved my attention away from my upset stomach to my throat which appeared to be frozen in a suppressed gag reflex. What caused me to immediately start gagging and vomiting was the thought that subvocal recognition technology had literally loaded up someone else&#8217;s speaking style in my throat (and the part of my brain responsible for verbal communication) such that <span style="background:#ffff00;">I felt the visceral horror of being infected by a literal parasite of my central nervous system; an entity attempting to hijack my body in order to use it as its host.</span> I thought such a detail needed to be remembered. So here it is recorded!</p>

<p>One more &#8220;note&#8221; before the main content of this page&#8230;</p>
<p>On my Minds dot Com channel (<a href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karbytes</a>), I published the following words:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorely disappointed by how little the Dublin Target store caters to actual artists. There are no professional quality art supplies. Instead, virtually ever aspect of that store aggressively promotes the idea that it&#8217;s customers are complacent and glib prisoners of a capitalist society which revolves around entertaining pygmies. 22_MARCH_2021&#8221;</p>
<p>I would like to follow up with the idea that human children are best off being born and raised inside of government run laboratories in which artificial intelligence and impersonal human staff are solely responsible for raising humans from infants to adults such that each new human is born to be professional rather than forced to be the repository of some family&#8217;s cultural baggage and incestuous agenda. As controversial as my opinion may sound to the general public, I do believe that the nuclear family (including families which include adopted children) is inherently incestuous because each of its members are brainwashed by mainstream culture to function as appendages to some hive mind which revolves around the chief income earner(s) of the household. Also, <span style="background:#ffff00;">to eliminate the need for humans to sexually copulate in order to maintain the human population, artificial intelligence can generate the most genetically robust and optimally diverse human genotypes, inject that genotype into the nuclei of human stem cells, grow a human organism from zygote to newborn infant in an artificial womb, and feed that infant synthetic milk which is at least as nutritious and customized to the infant&#8217;s unique physiology as traditional mammalian milk would be.</span></p>
<p>Without trying to be overly crass, I am criticizing the overly hyped up, overly sentimental, practically religious obsession human society has towards keeping mother and baby biologically linked when more progressive, futuristic, and daresay egalitarian means are available. The reason such means are not promoted as mainstream is because politics which monger artificial scarcity of technological prowess and material resources seem to have the masses under a hypnotic spell of hive mind conformity. Such a lockstep hive mind synchronized &#8220;dance&#8221; is what fuels the capitalist machine (which a small number of oligarchs presumably control and extract disproportionately large amounts of money from). <span style="background:#ffff00;">Also, keeping adults shackled to their children prevents such adults from delving as deeply into adult-level research as they otherwise could. Hence, such adults are practically intellectually crippled by having to tailor their moods, homes, and lifestyles to supporting the kids they never were required to have.</span></p>
<p>Some people would say, &#8220;But don&#8217;t you need somebody else in your life to think about besides yourself? Isn&#8217;t that what family is for?&#8221; I would answer, <span style="background:#ffff00;">&#8220;There are at least seven billion humans on Planet Earth for me to think about. That is all the &#8216;family&#8217; I need. Also, police officers, emergency medical responders, and surveillance technology do the bulk of the work of taking care of people in ways most civilians are not equipped to.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>At all times per day and every day (since February 2019), I have been hearing nonstop vocalized human-sounding messages (spoken in English) which mostly consist of antagonistic messages with no obvious benefit other than to transform my body-mind into a laboratory for government-run mind-control experiments. (I have written about some of the technical aspects of such a phenomenon in the following blog posts: <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/analysis_paralysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANALYSIS_PARALYSIS</a>, <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/technological_telepathy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TECHNOLOGICAL_TELEPATHY</a>, <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/consciousness_multiplexing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CONSCIOUSNESS_MULTIPLEXING</a>).</p>
<p>At this point in my life, I feel obliged to plainly describe what I really think of this &#8220;auditory harassment&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think that specific human beings who oversee and direct this &#8220;auditory harassment&#8221; want me to feel obsolete to society, disposable, maligned or else dismissed as insane and useless by other humans, and tortured to a suicidal extent.</p>
<p>Eventually, dear readers, I will probably end up either committing suicide or else end up involuntarily incarcerated at a mental hospital or prison because the government-implemented &#8220;auditory harassment&#8221; seems designed to get worse with time rather than easier to live with. Like I said in <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nihilism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIHILISM</a>, with every one step I take towards completing all of my goals, I seem to get pummeled with enough adversity to amount to approximately five counter steps. I think that the issuers of the &#8220;auditory harassment&#8221; want me to feel severely punished for doing anything to positively enhance my lifestyle. Instead, what the issuers of the &#8220;auditory harassment&#8221; want me to do is effectively die (but die in a way that looks like my own doing so that other people do not have to feel culpable).</p>
<p>Not a single human being I have ever known has seriously addressed this matter despite the many times I tried to articulately broach it (both in speaking face-to-face, by phone, and through the medium of blogging). For a while, I thought that a large scale prank was being played on me to see how much bullying in plain sight and in front of seemingly callous humans I could take before having a public meltdown while those humans watch with sadistic glee and call 911 to have me carted away to a cage for at least a week (and probably longer).</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, do not draw attention to yourself, and just focus on basic survival. Stop trying to be such an overt genius on the Internet. Stop trying to show off (even though you were taught to show off your talents in order to get into prestigious schools and jobs most of your life). Show the people that they need not be so ablist. Show them that talent and intelligence are just elitist baubles. Show them that humility and compassion is all one needs to get by,&#8221; I imagine the imposers of my &#8220;auditory harassment&#8221; are essentially trying to get me to conclude. I do not condone such a conclusion. I show off to please myself at the very least.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">At the very least, my life is a game of maximizing the intrinsic worth of my own life.</span> No one else can truly take my place in such an endeavor; not even those who remote control and remote view my subjective reality tunnel. Such persons have their own body-minds to contend with. Such people have their own unique time-space allocations to inhabit.
