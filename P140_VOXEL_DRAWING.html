<strong>VOXEL:</strong> a unit of three-dimensional Cartesian space (which is a static region bound by three axes which intersect at perpendicular angles at the origin point of the voxel grid).

By "static", I mean to imply that purely abstract space is inert (i.e. does not morph (which means that the voxels are timelessly rigid structures stacked together as boxes with no space in between)).
