<p>Like being drunk on wine, poverty is an altered state of consciousness (and not the same thing as being sober). While poor, every day feels like my last to enjoy whatever there is for me to enjoy and to accomplish whatever there is for me to accomplish before getting bogged down by an avalanche of debts and duties which &#8220;must&#8221; be dealt with in order to get out of the prison of a &#8220;bad&#8221; day.</p>
<p>I have not had a &#8220;bad&#8221; day for so long that every day has felt like a carpe diem experience. I have been an urban camper and unpaid writer and web developer for months. The only money I have been living on is the money my mother has been willing to transfer to me via PayPal (which has been enough to survive on and to enjoy some occasional cheap luxuries with). I am tentatively planning on reapplying to Tesla as a factory employee like I did last year as soon as June arrives (since that is when I am eligible for rehire). Customer service and food handling jobs are options as well. It may be several years before I am qualified for higher-paying and comparatively prestigious jobs such as software engineering and laboratory technician work.</p>
<p>What is now becoming a bigger priority that &#8220;the money game&#8221; for me is getting in touch with my childish wonder and appreciation for nature, science, and art without all the pretentious adult baggage. Right now, I am laying down in a wide open field enjoying the spring weather and the bunnies, birds, wildflowers, and humans in what looks and feels like a modern zoo. I love hanging out in beautiful patches of urban wilderness. I know where the drinking water fountains, bathrooms, good food stores, gear stores, medical centers, and electrical outlets are located and I am quite familiar with the East Bay region and how it &#8220;works&#8221;. I am spending a lot of time living as an anthropologist studying humans in their &#8220;natural&#8221; habitats to see how I might fit in in terms of immediate paid employment. Honestly, the realest part of me wants to do physical science more than computer science. Hence, I might decide to become some kind of lab technician instead of a programmer as my career job. Until I can afford to pay for my own career training and certification, I will need some kind of entry-level job so that I can do more than survive and do unpaid research and development. I feel quite optimistic yet &#8220;appropriately&#8221; worried since there is so much uncertainty and ignorance. Hence, my life is a drunkard&#8217;s walk although I almost never voluntarily drink alcohol.</p>
