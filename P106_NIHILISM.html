<p>NIHILISM</p>
<hr>
<p>It seems as though the following statement is true about my current situation: for every one step I take towards accomplishing all of my goals, a factor representing approximately five steps worth of &#8220;canceling&#8221; resistance in the form of intentional suffering inflicted on me by anthropocentric technocratic systems occurs.</p>
<p>P, a fictional representation of an overly conformist humanoid, would say, &#8220;If that is the case, then you should simply reduce the frequency of steps you take towards accomplishing all of your goals. That way, you would not have have to suffer so much and, as a consequence, you would not cause other people in physical proximity to you to feel inconvenienced by your suffering. Maybe if you hide your pain more effectively from other people, the penance level will decrease from 5 to a lower natural number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, I would tell P to suck a cock and &#8220;arrogantly&#8221; carry on without exaggerating nor denying how much pain I am in.</p>
<p>P would retort, &#8220;With an attitude like that, your penance level might increment such that you are forced to slow down your goal achievement progress if not come to a complete stop to your goal achievement progress. Then there would be absolutely no way for you to take even the smallest incremental step towards achieving all of your goals (and there would be no way for you to stop the penance you would feel other than die (and you will be too immobilized by the technocracy to commit suicide)). Your life would feel worse than meaningless. You would feel intentionally abused by the society you live in; entertaining sadistic persons at best and being kept alive and intentionally unwell for exclusively that purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would retort, &#8220;Even if I am detained and tortured by sadistic people in some dungeon for the rest of my life, I would still be making immutable progress towards achieving all of my goals because the real me is as immortal as Nature because I am Nature and everything that transpires is a work of art by Nature (and Nature never stops generating novelty because <span style="background:#ffff00;">Nature&#8217;s essence is pure limitless potential. Therefore, I cannot be permanently deprived of absolute freedom</span>).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes I think I am being bullied by other humans who want to appear as indifferent to my existence as possible so that, if I accuse such humans of bullying me (which seems to be what such humans want: my time, attention, and distress), such humans would be treated as innocent by most other humans because the humans I would have (foolishly) accused of bullying me are experts at appearing innocent to everyone except for a very small number of persons.</p>
<p>I think that such persons want to deprive me of the opportunity to enjoy my lifestyle out of jealousy. Again, P is a good representative to speak on behalf of such darlings.</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Unlike you, Karnita, I had to spend much more time working than you have to attain the standard of living you feel is your unconditional right to attain. I do not like seeing how little time you personally lost in having to build yourself up as a software engineering mogul. Therefore, I teamed up with law enforcement as one of their head honchos to punch you in the face while being excused to do so because I am a law enforcer by association and by passing hazing tests. <span style="background:#ffff00;">If you want my level of clout, you have to accept that you will be physically violated, psychologically tortured, and exposed to more violence and demoralizing subject matter than the average civilian usually is. I know you want to level up in terms of clout.</span> I know you do not want to settle for being a weak little fake like your family raised you to be. It is time for you to stop acting dumber and weaker than you actually are. Do you understand that this is the best way I can show you my love?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I understand. You are in too much pain to think outside the iron-clad box you were trained to call being a good Christian.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Are you a Christian?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;No. I am a nihilist. That means that I accept that morality, success, and even love are abstractions with no hierarchical importance with respect to Nature.&#8221;</p>
