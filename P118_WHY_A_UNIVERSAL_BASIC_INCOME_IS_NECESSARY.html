WHY_A_UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME_IS_NECESSARY

<hr>

Firstly, if the reader would like to skip all this poppycock rubbish about "intelligent" apes fighting over definitions and territories, please skip straight to the <strong><a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_based_economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLAR_BASED_ECONOMY</a></strong> page (arguably the most important page within this entire website).

While I do my contemplation, writing, and other improvisations in the motel room which I have rented for two nights in a row, I cannot help but feel physically sickened by the cigarette smoke seeping through the door which connects to the adjacent room (and, at times, through the window to the outside).

Like a good white guy "should" (according to the tyrannical masses of weaklings, idiots, and supporters of terrorism, pollution, and child abuse), I superficially pretend not to mind the cigarette smoke. After all, like any white guy selected at random (especially a geek with a penchant for computer programming and Internet mastery), I have the highest standard of living humanly possible (across the entire human population throughout all history). According to "the moral majority", I have no right to complain about being physically assaulted unless "the moral majority" decides that my complaints are paired with an appropriately sensationalist, exaggerated, gory, and lucrative opportunity to profit off of my suffering (because, as a white male with prestige, I do not suffer quite as "noisily" as I would otherwise).

"Please do not hurt me," is the cringe-worthy squeak of appeasement I refuse to cry (because that is what "the weaker vessels" would seemingly do (and such plaintive squeaking would only make a sadist feel even more gratified (which only fans the flames of which char my "tortured" spirit particle)).

Instead of cry, I write and gamble. I try not to gloat (even if "the weaker vessels" feel conditioned to expect me to strut like I should be proud of myself for merely practicing what I preach).

Thank you, oh "weaker vessels" for helping me have some resistance to push against to build my strength. You are certainly more useful than mere dead weight. Playing devil's advocate might be how you are paid. I do not want to come between you and your source of income. Seriously. I just want to be that chill hippie robot cat person in the corner (one of potentially many) who does its absolute best to minimize its own harmful impact. 

Generally, the less a person generates pollution, the more intelligent that person is. Just saying. I have standards. I am not sorry.

Finally, if the reader would rather not be conditioned to want to commit suicide and/or homicide as a result of living in a society in which people are pitted against each other as a result of "artificial scarcity" of monetizable and desired resources, please see the following proposal for an economy which, if implemented correctly, would leave no citizen destitute:
