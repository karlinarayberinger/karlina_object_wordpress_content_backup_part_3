<p>WHY</p>
<hr>
<p>Today I went to Whole Foods in Dublin, California (after spending the night at the nearby Motel 6) and bought a gourmet cup of coffee for only $3. Then I went to the nearby Barnes &amp; Noble to buy a collector&#8217;s hard cover edition of (The Illustrated) A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell (two books in one) by Stephen Hawking for less than $30.</p>
<p>I bought the book because it seems to be the perfect antidote to all that religious crap (new age, Eastern religion, and the Koran included) which I would &#8220;normally&#8221; waste my time and energy on as I struggle to cherry pick the most salient bits of scripture from an &#8220;appropriately&#8221; diverse range of religious and self-help texts to use as the input &#8220;seed&#8221; for generating my own (absolutely perfect) religious text.</p>
<p>Now that I am no longer as naive as the sophomore I used to be, I now see much deeper into what I used to get carried away with at a comparatively superficial level of understanding. Now I see Jesus Christ as a trope for why sacrificial murder is in vain and how Stephen Hawking attempted to transcend his body&#8217;s mortality and limitations by inquiring deeply into how black holes work and by communicating his understandings in a user-friendly book. It is like having a friend I can relate to on a deep and timeless level which I can carry with me in my backpack so that, at &#8220;random&#8221; times, I can take the book out of the &#8220;shelf&#8221; and look inside it for just a &#8220;hit&#8221; of inspiration.</p>

<p>There is a bounty of electrical outlets suitable for charging my phone and laptop computers at Dublin BART station&#8217;s parking garage. Based on everything I currently know, the local police stealth monitor the usage of such outlets in order to prevent one person from taking too much &#8220;free&#8221; electricity. Without such policing, there would be small-scale territorial disputes over regions of the garage. In summary, the main job of the police in an (almost) utopia is to prevent each person from becoming excessively greedy or excessively deprived.</p>

<p>A note on gerrymandering (i.e. arbitrary territory boundary definition generation)&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho Town&#8221; (Hayward, California) appears to be a miniature replica of Los Angeles, California; especially in terms of air quality and the heavy reliance on petroleum combustion. I treat &#8220;Ho Town&#8221; like a miniature replica of Jerusalem as well because it apparently exists as a refuge for those who want to preserve the outdated anti-environmental, anti-free-will, and anti-diversity culture which gives &#8220;Ho Town&#8221; its distinctly barbaric flavor. Hence, I shall make my business trips to &#8220;Ho Town&#8221; as infrequent and as non-disturbing to the local population as possible.</p>

<p>A note on why I chose Stephen Hawking to be my immortal coworker prototype&#8230;</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking was inflicted with a disabling disease which almost killed him at a young age and which left him in a state of almost full paralysis. He painstakingly did his work as an astrophysicist and science writer despite his extreme limitations (and with assistance from machines and from fellow humans). Stephen Hawking is currently dead at this time of writing, but his iconic work and character exists in the public Internet&#8217;s memory at this time. I hope Stephen Hawking is enjoying the next step of his cosmological journey.</p>
