<p>DYSTOPIA</p>
<hr>
<p>Note: At the time of writing this page, I am gratefully ensconced in a comfortable motel room (which I rented out for multiple nights in a row while I recover from a terrible stomach flu which left me vomiting and shitting watery stools and feeling very gross in the stomach). I think the worst of my stomach flu is over. Nevertheless, I will try to rest and not stress myself out. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Living like a runaway for so long has been very taxing on my body and mind.</span> I hope to never have to settle for such a miserable existence again. When I go back to the other side of the mountains, I will make my health a higher priority than my clout on the Internet. <span style="background:#ffff00;">In some ways, I sacrificed my physical body in order to launch my website and pack it full of as much raw material as possible.</span> (By &#8220;raw material&#8221;, I mean candid impressions of situations which I write about as close to the actual situation as possible. For example, I tend to publish blog post updates about events such as getting bitten by a pit bull (see <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/therapeutic_violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THERAPEUTIC_VIOLENCE</a>) within hours of the event&#8217;s occurrence). It is hard to sustain such an output pattern, however. I cannot and do not want to resume having to eat such large amounts of food (and coffee) in short sessions because, during that time of situational bulimia, ENERGY was the only currency I had left to wield (during my most desperate moments of poverty). And I did not want to look like a waif (i.e. a person who is easy to abuse). Now I do not mind looking like an old and weathered crone who has done plenty of hard time out on the road and hunting and gathering in the modern wilderness. (Because I would rather present myself as a celibate old monk instead of a young piece of ass, I am probably less likely to get sexually harassed). I want to come home with a more realistic approach to life rather than operating like a slave to some tyrannical teenage autistic retard bully (who treats me like some toy with no life outside of being that tyrant&#8217;s toy). This is the last gory retrospective journal entry I intend to write while on this vacation.</p>

<p>Note: In this &#8220;episode&#8221;, P is loosely based off AJP, a real human character in my life. Up close, AJP seems like a humble, nonchalant, and &#8220;normal&#8221; person, but from a distance he seems to be a possessive and hypocritical control freak who wants to stalk, harass, and disenfranchise me (as punishment for moving on from our &#8220;friends with benefits&#8221; situation too quickly for his ego to stand and for deriving intrinsic enjoyment from myself instead of having to pay to breathe as he seems to want). I expect more humans to side with AJP than with me because most people seem to think that AJP is appropriately chauvinistic (and that I am inappropriately egalitarian). <span style="background:#ffff00;">In short, I live in a world in which I am exposed to significant hardship as a result of not being at some man&#8217;s beck and call.</span></p>

<p>Q: &#8220;I noticed that most women settle for careers which pay them to be patient with difficult people rather than be competent at solving difficult problems. I do not see women pursuing careers which are not predominantly social instead of impersonal unless such woman are generously supported by either their family of origin (her head-of-household father) or else their comparatively wealthy husband. Basically, a woman&#8217;s career path is mostly the product of what her parents want (and she tends to marry a spouse who acts a substitute for her parents; an authority she can defer to).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Get back to the kitchen, Q. Make me a sandwich or else I will call 911 to have you permanently evicted from my house (which you do not own because only I make payments on it).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;Yes sir. Here is your sandwich. I hope it is to your liking.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I hope you did not poison it. If I get sick, you are the first person to blame. Anyway, I actually think what you had to say earlier was interesting enough for me to want more of. I usually never ask you to elaborate on some idea of yours because I am overwhelmed by how much real work I do (and you are just a lowly kitchen wench who is intermittently homeless). Tell me, Q: why do you not want to work a more stressful yet lucrative job so that you can earn your full-time keep at my house as more than a closeted mistress but, instead, my domestic angel and eventual mother to my unborn sons?&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;The truth is, P, I do not want to get married or have kids. I just want a more fulfilling career path. I want to be a professional software engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I disapprove! I am a professional software engineer. I do not want to support my competitor. I just wanted you to be my homemaker and heir spawning point. I want you to have no time to yourself outside work. I want you to have no enjoyment of your work. I want you to be in constant pain so that you are too weak and distraught to leave me. Being a kitchen wench is too good for you. I can ask your boss to fire you because he and I are close friends (and he likes me so much more than he likes you). In fact, if it was not for me recommending you to his sandwich shop as an employee, you would have most likely been denied employment. Notice doors only open for you when I want them to? Notice how you only wear clothes I buy for you (and anything I do not buy for you gets stolen by my army of stealthy thugs)? Even the words you choose to speak are words I trained you to select. Even if you run away from me, I know where you are at all times and what you are thinking at all times (thanks to the subvocal recognition technology and locators I forcibly installed in your body). You have no choice but to wait for me to tell you what to do. I am the source of your agency and creativity. I love your body; not your mind. I want your mind to be drowned out by the propaganda and harassment I force you to experience constantly through a brain-to-computer interface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;Why are you so mean to me and how do you get away with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I am a rich and popular gangster who bribes law enforcement and reputable thugs to do my bidding so that I can spend most of my time developing &#8216;train yo bitch&#8217; software in my lair while scantily clad women I rent like party favors serve me beer and drugs, answer the lobby phone, and perform various butler tasks for me while I play head honcho in my lair at the top of a skyscraper building.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I want no part in your empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Bitch, I can do whatever I want. I am practically invincible and unstoppable. You are just a meat robot I invested lots of time in conditioning to be my trophy wife (after I forced you to endure homelessness, incarceration, brainwashing, battery, theft, and other adversarial situations which are intended to eventually render you permanently destitute so that you will become unconditionally loyal to me as your savior from such adversity).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I would rather commit suicide than put up with your abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I will not let you commit suicide. I am going to beat you unconscious, throw you in the back of a vehicle, and have my monkey men drive you to the sec slaves brothel. You get to be a sex slave for a few weeks. I will take you out of there when I am sure you have suffered as much as I want you to. Then it will be back to business as usual. You will return to being my subservient and terrorized servant who makes me sandwiches the way I like them each and every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;There is no such thing as an alpha female human. Only the male humans are alpha. The sexual dimorphism between men and women exists because men killed the women they did not want to mate with. The men killed their female competitors and enslaved the comparatively smaller, weaker, and neonatal females in forced marriage and rape sans birth control. This tradition has persisted for thousands of years. That is why the world seems to revolve around men while women default to being Stockholm Syndrome victims; people who tell themselves no better life exists than the slavery they are coerced into subsisting on. Such women are content to just watch light-hearted television as their only pastime outside of slave labor. Such women have almost no time alone because they are always the designated babysitter of their offspring and because they are forced to make friendship rather than intelligence their source of sustenance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;A universal basic income would solve this. Then people would merely have to exist to be supported in continuing to exist. In fact, karbytes wrote a succinct technical document on how to instantiate a universal basic income based on solar cell output: <strong><a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_based_economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLAR_BASED_ECONOMY</a></strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Shut up! Daddy wants a show. He don&#8217;t want bitches to get out of jail for free. He don&#8217;t want the world to be all peaceful and happy. Daddy P wants all women to feel inherently inferior to men so that Daddy P can keep nutting off on his favorite masturbatory premise: the idea that he can make any woman his personal slave and crash test dummy and that no one will seriously oppose his will because he resonates with humans on a deep, primal level. Daddy P is a king imbued with Godly powers.&#8221;</p>
