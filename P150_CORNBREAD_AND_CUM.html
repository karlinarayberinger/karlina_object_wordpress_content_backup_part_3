<p>CORNBREAD_AND_CUM</p>
<hr>
<p>As I write this note, I am eating a big slab of cornbread which I purchased for approximately $3 at the local Whole Foods Market. While I was incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail last year, cornbread was a celebrated favorite &#8220;luxury&#8221; amongst the inmates. It tastes even better outside under the big blue sky.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I wrote a bunch of plaintive blog posts while hiding in a motel room and worrying about having to possibly go back to prison again because I might not be able to pay the fine I still apparently owe by next month&#8217;s court date. Also, my mother is showing the signs of not wanting to give me any money unless I do everything her way rather than my way. She wants me housebound where she and her lackeys can keep a constant watch over me. She also wants me to hurry up and get a job immediately rather than wait until I am eligible to reapply for the job I prefer in approximately two months. This morning she said I should legally claim myself disabled so that the government will pay for my basic living expenses instead or her. She also said that I should just look for some other person to depend on to take care of me. In summary, my mother&#8217;s worldview is quite chauvinistic and myopic. That is why I stay away from the estates she polices (and where her lackeys do her bidding). The best way to deal with my parents is to minimize my involvement with them because they tend to only want to make me regress into being just another cat around the house instead of a worldly human.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;Today I posted the following little blurb on Minds dot Com (<a style="background:#00ff00;color:#000000;" href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karbytes</a>):</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not said anything proactive in a while, so here goes: I am gonna set up some kind of crowd funding donation portal, do &#8220;micro jobs&#8221; such as taking paid surveys online, and apply for a regular job (no later than 01_JULY_2021). Today is 30_MARCH_2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said that to placate my general audience (and myself to some extent) so that I can stop obsessing over money in such a myopic fashion and focus on more personally important (and interesting) matters. I do not have the luxury to plan ahead by more than a day due to my complicated circumstances. That is okay. I an learning to be a professional modern survivalist and not just some microscopic philosopher king counseling deaf giants. Time to migrate to the next location.</p>
<p>One more thing before I send this note out into cyberspace&#8230;</p>
<p>I am currently able to see through the dark clouds of last night&#8217;s cabin fever. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I see that most human beings are decent (i.e. creatures who intend no harm and who usually want to be helpful to their fellow humans).</span> I will not let a few rotten apples spoil the bunch. Chauvinism is falling out of vogue as global civilization advances and learns to conduct itself more harmoniously and happily. As more and more people become well-educated, the kinds of bullying I was formerly conditioned to expect as inevitable and normal will be disincentivized until it practically no longer exists.</p>
<p>Okay, one last thing&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><span style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">This monolith of a website is my spaceship which I am populating with robot crew members. I intend to keep expanding this enterprise so that my crew and I can traverse the cosmos and cross the event horizons of black holes (into the &#8220;unknown&#8221; in the hopes that we will arrive on the other side of a wormhole in tact). My goal is to make my enterprise immortal and able to travel between multiple universes.</span></strong></p>
