<p>SIT_DOWN_BE_HUMBLE</p>
<hr>
<p>Note: the following &#8220;dialogue&#8221; is a depiction of a hypothetical (i.e. fictional) relationship between two human beings. P is an angry gangster. Q is a &#8220;victim&#8221; of P&#8217;s tyranny and ability to hypnotize large numbers of people into thinking as he wants them to. Because of P&#8217; overwhelming popularity and control of the general human population, Q is regarded as a villain and scapegoat throughout this dark &#8220;parallel reality&#8221; situation. (Perhaps I, the author of P and Q, am the only person throughout all the multiverse who really feels motivated to rescue Q. I cannot help but feel that most other humans would complacently leave Q to rot and suffer in P&#8217;s line of fire. Hence, I cannot help that most people would automatically comply with P and dismiss Q as a lunatic and wayward woman. Obviously, my opinion of humanity is not very high. Then again, I hardly know any human on a non superficial level. Even so, <span style="background:#ffff00;">I doubt I will meet anyone even half as deep and compassionate as I am any time within the next ten years</span>).</p>

<p>P: &#8220;I do not like how unemotional and quick you are to move on with your own life after I dumped you and ghosted you. I do not like how useless, ugly, and insignificant you made me feel by not appearing to be genuinely sad over the loss of my physical and mental availability to you and the way I let you be a very important member of my clan for a while. Most importantly, I did not like the fact that, while we were dating, only I was going to work and earning a livable wage. Also, I did not like the fact that only I seemed to have friends and social obligations. You, on the other hand, were like some overgrown kid that refused to work and who refused to make other people a high enough priority. I know you are smart and capable of making at least as much money as I do. I will not stop harassing you until I feel satisfied by how much money you make which I will get at least half of because I convinced the law to treat us as a married couple (whether you like it or not and whether you know it or not). That is what you get for dating me when I told you I only had enough room in my life for my job and not a romantic relationship. You should not have tempted me into getting into a romantic relationship with you. I have convinced authoritative people that I am the victim of your selfishness. You made me feel obligated to look after you. So I pretended to be okay with being your boyfriend until you just got too annoying to put up with. I feel that you owe me more than just money: you owe me the right to prevent you from getting and keeping a job so that you forced to rely on the government for disability payments (and <span style="background:#ffff00;">I have been colluding with your family against you to ensure that I have their permission and assistance in rendering you obsolete to the workforce using brain-to-computer interface technology to distract you whenever your cognitive activity level exceeds a certain threshold</span>).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I hired people to knock you unconscious in order to install a brain-to-computer interface inside your body which uses subvocal recognition to read your verbal thoughts and which bombards your auditory processing centers with deliberately distracting sound effects (especially at times when your cognitive functioning appears to exceed a certain level of rigor). That is right. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I am forcing your brain to adapt to being withholding of mathematical thoughts.</span> I graduated from a prestigious university with a degree in mathematics. I single-handedly worked my way out of poverty like a prodigy. You barely even graduated high school. You do not deserve to partake in mathematics beyond a third-grade level. I want you to feel passed up by little kids because it adds to my goal of making you feel obsolete to the kind of workforce you want to be part of. You just did not want it enough while you had the chance. Now it is too late. You might as well get used to staying at home all day to take care of your aging parents (and standing by to take orders from me and the minions I hired to look after you while I am too busy to monitor and control you). We use brain-to-computer interfaces to determine your exact location in space, the verbalized thoughts which you are currently thinking, and all sensory data which your body is processing and which our technology picks up and transmits to us. There is nothing you can do to escape our meddling. <span style="background:#ffff00;">We want to make sure that your life is harder than you planned. That is because you have enjoyed a much easier life than most people have.</span> In short, you have been spoiled until I started torturing you (and you are a lot less annoying as a result of me getting to have my way with you (thanks to technology and the law enforcement who always seems to take my side against you (and how even your own friend and family seem to always take my side against you))). Stop insinuating that I want you to get pregnant. I do not. I want you to stay an infant for the rest of your life. I do not want you to have friends. I do not want you to have hobbies. I do not even want you to have a private room to call your own. I want you to feel stripped naked of your privacy and dignity. I want you to have a nervous breakdown in public as many times as possible. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I want you to feel and to look distressed. I want to destroy whatever sources of pride and joy remain (especially &#8220;intrinsic&#8221; sources).</span> What that will leave you with is a humble servant&#8217;s body; someone who is content to lie on her back and stay bedridden while I make her the captive audience of my rantings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Stop being insecure. Sheesh! I swear I won&#8217;t let anything bad happen to ya. I&#8217;ll keep you alive. I&#8217;ll make sure there is a roof over your head. I just don&#8217;t want you getting out of bed. I just don&#8217;t want you doing anything other than being my captive audience and companion at all times. Most women would die for such an opportunity to be treated like an infant who never has to grow up because their doting husband will never leave them alone. I made sure that your thoughts will be replaced by the thoughts I want you to hear. I want you to forget what your own voice and language sounds like. I am sick of you, Q. It is time for you to forget Q too. No one likes Q because Q is a selfish overgrown child who does not love other people enough. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I want you to stay close to your parents and regress back into childhood. Your life does not have to be so harsh and worldly if only you stay (mostly) housebound and (mostly) bedridden.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Stop complaining. If you keep complaining, I will make sure bad things happen to you (and the more you complain (even silently), the more severe the bad things will be). Eventually, if you do not stop complaining, I will ensure that you be incarcerated in prison because I will make you commit a crime. Alternatively, I will report you as suicidal to the police and have you incarcerated at a psychiatric hospital until and unless you learn to comply with my wishes. Don&#8217;t you understand that, since President Trump&#8217;s inauguration, the entire human world has proven itself to be easily seduced by charismatic narcissists? That&#8217;s how I get my way. I am just as powerful as Trump. I understand that, when push comes to shove, brute strength is why I will always have the upper hand in our relationship. I simply have more allies and resources than you do. That is why I deserve to have a better standard of living than you. Unlike you, I was willing to put aside my childish interests in order to become a stoic and unoriginal soldier. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I think you worry too much about the environment. You should just surrender to the petroleum industry and accept that no one wants to treat you with respect until you agree to support the petroleum industry. It&#8217;s how most of us get around. Get over it!</span> When your parents and I decide you are ready to work, you will work as a fast food restaurant employee so that you can give me half of your wages. Otherwise, I will make your life hell. I may even escalate things into physical violence. The law pretty much lets me do whatever I want because I have friends in high places. You don&#8217;t. I know how friendless you are. I will prevent anyone of high status from knowing you exist. Only I, your family, and your coworkers will know you exist (and you will be outed as having a mental disability which requires other people to override your mind and body to prevent you from falling into destructive ways). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I can make up whatever bullshit I want about you. No one has ever openly disagreed with me (and people are extremely easy to seduce).</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Shut up. Let me and my buddies fill your head with our voices. You own voice is a bore. You are a whore. You deserve to be ridiculed and distracted and nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;It&#8217;s not about you, Q. This is not about your welfare. It&#8217;s about mine. You have been spoiled for the first part of your life. The remainder of your life is different. Now it&#8217;s my turn to feel good at your expense. This is how my group and I fight for social justice. We steal from the rich to give to the poor. We rip apart vain bitches who only have their inherited wealth and social status to be proud of. We destroy the special snowflake people who think they deserve to have special gender pronouns and such. You need to suffer. Enough people of importance have voted that it is in their best interest that you be tortured. <span style="background:#ffff00;">We rejoice in seeing the elitists suffer.</span> Such people are most deserving of our humbling conditioning. Eventually, you will think and act like a subservient pet. I will deprive you of physical affection other than rape by strangers. I want you to feel cold, sore, and tired on a daily basis. I want you to feel dirty, smelly, unkempt, and homely most of the time. If you acquire nice things, I will ensure that such things are stolen from you and/or broken. I&#8217;m trying to help you get over your material attachments (your body included). You owe me gratitude. It&#8217;s not an easy task to get a whore like you to stop being so attached to her body. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Just accept that you were not meant to live for more than a few decades and that you are not meant to stay physically or mentally fit past your most fertile years.</span>&#8221;</p>
