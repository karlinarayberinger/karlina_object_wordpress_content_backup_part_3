<p>BENEVOLENT_MURDER</p>
<hr>
<p>P: &#8220;I am not sure what to do with my life yet I do not want to be told what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;If you stay in that condition of indecision and refusal to accommodate other persons, then I will have to detain you and put you in a rehabilitation center for up to three years (with the hope that you become mentally sane enough to return to society as quickly as possible).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;That is a violation of my freedom to practice my own religion. My religion permits me to do whatever it takes to avoid having to accommodate others nor to generate any monetary value.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;What you are you; a baby that does not want to grow up? You remind me of my biological father. As far as I currently know, my biological father is someone I would definitely appoint to be painlessly and quickly murdered. That is because he seems to have no genuine desire to spare others the harm his extremely selfish existence inevitably inflicts. He refuses to accommodate other humans. Everything he does is to sustain his cigarette addiction and entitlement to being treated as forever innocent by the community. Bye Dad! Anyway, back to you, P. You represent many people who may need to be assassinated for the sake of every person (you included, P).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Karlina, I am afraid that you have not feigned sympathy and affection for your biological parents. In one day you basically sentenced both of your parents to be quickly and painlessly murdered. Is that true?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Yes. I sentenced both of my parents to be quickly and painlessly murdered. Of course, I have no desire to harm any person (self included). I am just saying that, if I had that kind of executive power, I would sentence specific persons to quick and painless execution.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Why do you want to minimize the suffering of those you sentence to be executed?&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">karbytes: &#8220;Any pain is my pain. I want to minimize my suffering. Duh!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>P: &#8220;That is not true of me (and I seem to have the advantage in terms of evolution as a result of having so little empathy).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Your nervous system has a delusionally incomplete filter which cannot protect you from the interconnectedness of all phenomena (whether you are aware of this causality of not).&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Please kill me. I do not want to be in this organism anymore. I do not even mind missing out on the transhumanist revolution. I do not mind missing out on traveling to planets other than Earth or becoming a cyborg with superhuman abilities. Please put me out of my misery. I do not want to suffer anymore. I know my suffering has hurt others. I do not want to improve my conduct. I feel intense resentment towards humanity and I am convinced that my continued survival is personally not worthwhile. Do you understand what I mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I hope so. I think so. Come with me. I will escort you to the suicide chamber. Let us be silent as we walk. All the steps will be painless. You need not say anymore. <span style="background:#ffff00;">The neural interface is a better translator of your brain than I am.</span> The machines will guide our way to your final location.&#8221;</p>
