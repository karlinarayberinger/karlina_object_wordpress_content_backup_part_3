<p>HOW_I_NEVER_PROCRASTINATE (unabridged)</p>

<p><strong>Problem # 1: Normalized Petroleum Dependence</strong></p>
<p>As long as consumers keep buying and using petroleum powered vehicles (and other devices), humans are not doing enough to promote pollution-free energy.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Problem # 2: Obsolete Population Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>Given that virtually any tissue, organ, or even whole organism can be generated using stem cells which are either derived from a &#8220;natural&#8221; genetic lineage or else &#8220;artificial&#8221; synthetic genes generated entirely (or partially) by computers (i.e. artificial intelligence), every new human being (and human body part replacement), can be produced in a laboratory with zero human input. Artificial intelligence can precisely calibrate 100% AI controlled population size maintenance and longevity by allocating material resources as needed according to objective rather than subjective algorithms and extremely large quantities of empirical data by which to do advanced engineering feats).</p>

<p><strong>Problem # 3: Groundless Economy</strong></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The current fiscal economies are driven by currencies of arbitrary unit worth.</span></p>

<p><strong>Problem # 4: Popular Denial of Technocratic Thought Policing</strong></p>
<p>Given that microscopic nanobots whose components include computational circuitry, electromagnetic transmitters (and receivers), chemical transmitters (and receivers), and the ability to communicate with electronic devices inside of the human body and outside of the body (and presuming that microscopic nanobots have permeated the bloodstream of every human already), all human activity (i.e. cognitive throughput, motor functionality, sensory throughput, and <span style="background:#ffff00;">atomic states</span> of constituent matter) is penetrated by and included within the &#8220;living&#8221; Internet of Things.</p>

<p><strong>Epilogue: Why I Have (Almost) No Money</strong></p>
<p>If each &#8220;friend&#8221; in my social networks (Minds dot Com, Facebook, LinkedIn, et cetera) donated exactly $1 to me each month, I would have a better quality of life because I would presumably net about $300 per month and use that money to rent motel rooms (which does wonders for my website development).</p>
<p>Why have I received (practically) no  donations each month since the start of this blog? After all, my PayPal donation link is supposedly (fully) accessible to the public. Therefore, if I have not yet received donations through that link by at least three of my social networking &#8220;friends&#8221; by now, I presume that my &#8220;friends&#8221; are either unaware of my donation link (and sense of entitlement to a universal basic income and the &#8220;right&#8221; to promote that &#8220;religion&#8221;) or else the government decided to withhold incoming donations and any information about such donations (especially <span style="background:#ffff00;">donation amounts, currency types, donor name, donor location, and date of the donation</span>) for an indefinite length of time.</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Kartwheelina, if only you would shut up, smile, and just watch television like a good little basic bitch would, you, my Lady In Waiting will be handsomely rewarded by Daddy Warbucks. Capiche?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Oh, silly Poopy P. All you advocate &#8216;the little people&#8217; to do is voluntarily sit out of enjoying the things in life you claim are only deserved by those of sufficient clout; not wit; not charm; not even desire to do no harm!&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I will pretend not to understand you. Now you rendered me inept. Goodbye!&#8221;</p>
