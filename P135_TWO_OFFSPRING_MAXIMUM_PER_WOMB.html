TWO_OFFSPRING_MAXIMUM_PER_WOMB

<hr>

As I write this note, I sit in the Dublin/Pleasanton BART parking garage; charging my Android phone and Lenovo (Kubuntu) laptop. Without disclosing the details of my recent experience while traveling from Castro Valley to Dublin/Pleasanton, I feel compelled to do a national president's job: define the terms of what I believe is a progressive means to mitigate unsustainable human population growth (within one "first world" country).

<span style="#ffff00;">After a citizen gives birth to two offspring, that citizen shall be permanently sterilized as soon as possible after its second offspring is born.</span> 

Such a sterilization procedure is arguably necessary because 

(a) Planet Earth already contains more human organisms than it can sustain long-term (which means that the human species will almost certainly go extinct within the next 500 years if the total human population size does not shrink to a more sustainable number),

(b) the current birth-to-death ratio of human organisms is currently too high for Planet Earth can sustain long-term (which means that the human species will almost certainly go extinct within the next 500 years if the birth-to-death ratio of human organisms does not reach a range of equilibrium)
