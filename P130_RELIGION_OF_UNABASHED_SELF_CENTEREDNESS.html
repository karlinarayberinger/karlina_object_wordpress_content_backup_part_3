<p>RELIGION_OF_UNABASHED_SELF_CENTEREDNESS</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The single most important point I am attempting to make in this post (and perhaps entire blog) is that no cause is more worthy of my devotion than is the unconditional promotion of free speech (i.e. the unrestricted public sharing of ideas via nonviolent means).</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The human species is only as strong as its weakest member. Either that weakest member becomes strong enough to be sufficiently unburdensome to the human species or else that weakest member is eliminated in order to save the species (or else the species perishes as a consequence of enabling unsustainable weakness in a sufficiently high number of sufficiently weak members).&#8221; &#8211; anonymous</p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Note: What I write is not necessarily an accurate depiction of how I currently feel. Usually, personal journal entries are an attempt to &#8220;finalize&#8221; issues I would rather not revisit unless such issues are relevant to current and future problem-solving.</span></p>

<p>I think now is the time to start a new religion called &#8220;I am just here to focus on myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fear that I will never reincarnate again once my human body dies (or, if I reincarnate, I will be thrown into more hellish circumstances than what I am currently living in for some indefinitely large number of times).</p>
<p>I fear that even my most valiant efforts to save Earth&#8217;s ecosystem and to reform human civilization such that all humans can enjoy a standard of living I find worthwhile is in vain; that I could easily get carried away in the fanatic endeavor of trying to change the world to my liking such that I wear myself out and &#8220;waste&#8221; my life desperately trying to achieve my &#8220;grandiose&#8221; goal only to find that my efforts were ineffective at best.</p>
<p>I fear that my good health makes other people so envious that I have to expect that there are always other people scheming to ruin my health to the extent that I am permanently and severely crippled at worst or chronically unwell at best.</p>
<p>I fear that my attraction to nature without the anthropocentric bias arouses hostility in other humans such that I am coerced into pretending to have no love outside of what other humans imagine is truth for all.</p>
<p>I fear that, despite my best efforts to be optimistic, realistic, articulate, benevolent, and interesting, my creative output will be censored (especially via the &#8220;shadow banning&#8221; of my Internet profiles such that I am never sure of how much public exposure my websites are actually garnering) such that only myself and the censoring agents would be aware of my creative output (and my efforts to share my creative output with the world will be and is in vain).</p>
<p>I fear that, no matter how urgently and sincerely I ask other people to acknowledge my creative output, most (if not all) other people will dismiss my creative output as unworthy of their time and consideration.</p>
<p>I fear that, no matter how urgently and sincerely I ask other people for practical assistance, I will be dismissed as lazy and insincere such that I am forced to withdraw my trust towards other people (and, as a consequence of not wanting to trust in the benevolence and efficacy of other humans, I will be demonized and sentenced to be punished indefinitely for the &#8220;crime&#8221; of not be living humans are mostly benevolent and competent at upholding the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm (and to minimize all suffering)).</p>
<p>At this time, I am disappointed in how unintelligent, lazy, violent, sadistic, ugly, burdensome, dishonest, and tyrannical humans generally are. There are so few humans I feel inspired to call role models that I basically have no human role models (and apparently my lack of human role models is a &#8220;crime&#8221; because that means I am just improvising every step of my life with no one to imitate because I find no human worthy for me to imitate).</p>
<p>Like I said at the top of this post, my new religion might as well be to focus on myself exclusively while the world spins chaotically with or without me. There is no human being I have ever known who has been even half as decent to me as I have been; and I do not expect that to change. I expect to have to occasionally ward off chauvinists who attempt to corner me into being the recipient of their &#8220;superior&#8221; love when all love really is (for humans) is seducing others through charm, wit, deceit, and, if all else fails, brute physical coercion (i.e. threat to commit bodily harm).</p>
<p>I shall retreat into my very selfish agenda and make Nature my only object of devotion (which includes making computer programming posts and creative writing posts). Goodbye!</p>
