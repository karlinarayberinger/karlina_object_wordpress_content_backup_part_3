<strong>ARRAY:</strong> a sequence of adjacent memory cells allocated to exactly one variable, A, such that A represents a linear sequence of discrete data elements and where A[i] represents the ith element of array A, where A[0] represents the leftmost (first) element of array A, where A[N - 1] represents the rightmost (last) element of array A, where N represents the total number of elements in array A, and where i is a nonnegative integer.
