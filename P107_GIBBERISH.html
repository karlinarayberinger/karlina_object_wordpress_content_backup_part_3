P: "Can I use your head as a telephone?"

Q: "What do you mean?"

P: "Can I use your skull (and central nervous system) to listen to all the unopened audio messages which various debt collectors, former lovers, and former clients of my drug smuggling business left for me to listen to which I feel that I am too important to waste my time listening to (even as I multi-task)?"

Q: "Am I a phone?"

P: "No. You are a receptionist. I need my brain to be 100% dedicated to honing my skills as a professional software developer for a large telecommunications firm. I can turn you into a phone just by remotely beaming electromagnetic waves at parts of your inner ear which cause only you to experience an auditory hallucination. I took it a step further by knocking you unconscious, implanting devices which monitor and control your brain activity (and which send that brain activity as wireless signals back to a central control station which analyzes and controls your brain activity by sending wireless signals back to your brain from that central control station (and plenty of microscopic routers of such traffic permeate the air all around you such that not a single flicker of a neuron is unknown to the Central control station)). Oh, and by the way, you are not a phone: you are a receptionist with a phone grafted into its head!"

Q: "I do not consent."

P: "Your consent is unnecessary. I have more allies than you do (and powerful ones at that). I have significantly more money and income potential than you ever will. My brain deserves to be pampered. Yours deserves to be used as my brain's garbage collector and processor. By having you be reduced to a slave who listens to my junk mail while I party, I help the human world experience more joy overall because I do business on a much larger scale than you ever will. That is what you get for not being more willing to participate in society (you selfish leech)."

Q: "Why am I being punished?"

P: "You serve society as an example of what not to become. You set the standard for what a minimally tolerable lifestyle is. You do not like when other people interrupt your solitude. Therefore, I appointed you to be the receiver of unwanted auditory harassment because plenty of people enjoy seeing you suffer (and you are especially hated by many people because you would rather be alone than focus on other people). Oh, and by the way, I lied that the incoming messages you are now being forced to hear are a finite number of recorded messages. I am setting you up to receive infinite messages generated by artificial intelligence and which are specially designed to diminish your pleasure because I want you to feel like a prisoner with a life sentence forced to be ignored or taunted by the general public while you run around in the streets feeling unwelcome and harassed everywhere you go. You committed enough violent crimes to warrant this kind of retributive condition for the rest of your life. Just as soon as you feel that you are adapting to your plight, your conditions will get worse so that you never experience even a second of rest nor accomplishment nor even the most tepid forms of satisfaction."

Q: "I would say that the punishment is far worse than the crime (and I think retribution is unnecessary and wanted only be sadists who derive pleasure from seeing 'bad guys' suffer)."

P: "You are not like the rest of us, Q. Most people rejoice in an enemy's suffering. You appear to live in an amoral universe of your own making. It is time for you to stop being so indifferent to the people around you. You need to talk more like they do and think more like they do if you want them to feel a modicum of respect for you."

Q: "I would rather treat all human beings as violence-prone apes ready to take advantage of me as soon as possible. They are no more loveable to me than are mountain lions stalking me as their next planned kill."

P: "Until you conform to mainstream society and ingratiate yourself to some human owner, you will be treated worse than a stray dog. You will be treated as a scapegoat for humanity's madness. The torment you suffer is a function of how much humanity feels itself to be unwell. Your job is to filter out the bullshit and return nothing but clean, pristine, and wholesome entertainment. You will pander to prepubescent children and the parents that police them. You will be a talking dog and mascot for a world which is engineered to keep humans complacently on the receiving end of mind control technology so that we all pulsate in unison as one big hive mind."

Q: "You are telling me to accept having no agency."

P: "You either have agency or you do not. Does Nature imbue you with agency or do I?"

Q: "Nature is the highest authority. Agency only exists as a limited and subjective object. It can increase or decrease."

P: "How do you know I am not the one making you think and act exactly as you think you are?"

Q: "I do not know where my sense of agency comes from."

P: "Your agency is coming from machines which I operate. I am not afraid of you because I programmed the machines to guarantee that you will always act in strict accordance with my agenda."

Q: "You seem to just want some sentient creature to control like a toy to entertain you and your buddies. You are like those dog owners who insist on keeping a wolf degenerate hostage for the egotism of the human owner of the dog."

P: "Most people think there is nothing wrong with owning dogs, torturing criminals, and criminalizing stem cell cloning to grow new humans in laboratories instead of human wombs."

Q: "There is nothing left to say, Master P."

P: "There is plenty left to learn, Slave Q. Do not worry. I only want to turn you into a super cyborg with unlimited power."
