<p>Note: The best page (in my opinion) which I have written thus far is <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_based_economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLAR_BASED_ECONOMY</a>, a technical document introducing an ecologically-sustainable and mathematically-sound system for implementing a universal basic income using currency derived from actual photovoltaic cell (i.e. solar cell) electrical output.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I have renounced driving the petroleum powered automobile my family let me borrow months ago. I do not recall driving it once this year. <span style="background:#ffff00;">It took me approximately two years to get into the habit of not driving at all and, instead, walking and using the BART train to travel around the Bay Area.</span> (I do not rely on my bicycle to get around because my bicycle was a target of frequent vandalism to the extent that it became too unreliable of a transportation means).</p>
<p>What eats up a significant portion of my time is walking (since that is the primary way I commute to various places such as the grocery store, electrical outlet hubs, and occasionally my legal address (which I avoid making trips to because I want to stay as independent and autonomous as possible and avoid situations in which I become too weak, sheltered, and lazy to easily leave the domicile).</p>
<p>I am tentatively planning on reapplying for a warehouse position at Tesla in Fremont no sooner than 01_JUNE_2021 since that is when I am allegedly eligible for rehire and because I doubt that I will be able to get an Information Technology career unless I am not so homeless and destitute as I have been. (Then again, perhaps I will find an Information Technology job sooner than I think. I also may end up getting a cashier job so that I do not have to lose so much time and health doing 12+ hour shifts back-to-back with very little time to do anything but sleep and eat in between shifts (which sounds like bulimia in the making)).</p>
<p>My mother has been giving me small amounts of cash (between $20 and $100 at a time and no more than approximately $180 per week). That is enough money to pay for my most basic necessities except for clothes and electronics (so really, I am only getting enough money from my mother to remain at this level of poverty). That is why I feel some pressure to get a job sooner rather than wait until I am more satisfied with my programming portfolio (and <span style="background:#00ff00;">I plan on making a smaller website exclusively for showcasing my best programming examples and technical writing to prospective employers</span>).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I am afraid of getting cut off from financial support just when I am about to get any job (or while I am working before I receive my first paycheck from that job). After all, my mother is not required to pay me &#8220;alimony&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>I am afraid that prospective employers are reluctant to hire me because they think I am mentally ill or simply an unlikable person and not because I lack skills, fortitude, and a desire to be of service to human civilization at large. I think many prospective co-workers and hiring managers would think I need to give up my &#8220;radical&#8221; lifestyle as a hermetic vegan anarchist philosophical type in favor of a more chirpy, conventional, meat-eating, petroleum-combusting &#8220;plastic&#8221; type. That is because capitalism tends to only acknowledge humanity on a superficial level. Capitalism is like prostitution. It is primarily a dance of supply and demand; buy and sell; and get it while it lasts (because, of course, such fake abundance is not sustainable long-term, so get what is peddled for a deceptively low price while supplies last).</p>
<p>Where do I sleep? Where do I shower? Where do I shit? Wherever it is most convenient. I do my best to be hygienic. I carry most of my possessions in my backpack everywhere I go. Sometimes I stay at motels to take a break from all that heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Why so few friends? <span style="background:#ffff00;">Despite having no job and no social commitments, the tasks of survival and working on my artistic and academic endeavors literally consumes all of my time and energy (though, when called to, I can push myself to accomplish more than I can stand; hence I go into a &#8220;super human&#8221; trance of manic hyper-productivity).</span> I am usually (but not always) exhausted by the end of each day (and sometimes days blend together because I skimp on sleep (but now I am not as willing to skimp on my health because I value my health more than it is seemingly socially acceptable to in a capitalist, martyrdom-promoting society). I am not yet sure how I will bridge the gap between how I live now and how I want to live. I want to enjoy a higher standard of living, obviously, but not at the expense of my &#8220;religious&#8221; preferences (which seem to sharply oppose the home-bound, family-centric, celebrity-worshipping, anthropocentric, money-obsessed, sex-obsessed, anti-ecological norm). I do have a modicum of faith sufficient to propel me forward that I will find a sweet spot between my &#8220;religious&#8221; preferences and &#8220;real world&#8221; career/job. That&#8217;s all I have to say for now. Time to go on a &#8220;hunt&#8221; for some vegan food. Later I hope to get started on another computer programming assignment. Thanks for your patience and understanding as I make my way out of the fog.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
