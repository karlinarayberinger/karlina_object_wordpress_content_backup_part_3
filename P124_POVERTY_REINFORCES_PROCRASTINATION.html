POVERTY_REINFORCES_PROCRASTINATION

<hr>

The poverty cycle is a chronic condition of living within a capitalist society as a human being who is expected to work at least 40 hours per week (earning so little money that one must either settle for a restrictively impoverished lifestyle or else accrue significant debt to avoid such deprivation) doing tasks which artificial intelligence would be able to perform at a fraction of the cost and with orders of magnitude more efficiency such that the human employee is forced to live in a chronic state of existential angst due to feeling relegated to menial chores and due to feeling deprived of the wellness comparatively wealthy humans seem to enjoy.

I noticed that, when I present myself to the public as non-destitute, I am treated like a sacred cow people want to acquire and milk for "free" goods. That is when people are about as overtly nice to me as I have ever seen them. When I present myself as destitute, I am not treated like a sacred cow with tits overflowing with gold milk. Instead, I am treated as a vampire. 

The main point I am attempting to make with this post is the proposition that it is physically impossible for a human being to be genuinely altruistic unless that human being is not too destitute. In other words, it is impossible to be of genuine service to society at large unless one is not settling for an overly destitute status quo (job and home life included).
