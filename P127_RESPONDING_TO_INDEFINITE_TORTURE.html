RESPONDING_TO_INDEFINITE_TORTURE

<hr>

Note: I may or may not be as tortured as I apparently sound. In fact, it is likely that I am erring on the side of sounding more wounded than I actually am as a decoy while I sneak my way into a better standard of living. (I am probably not as tortured as a prisoner of Guantanamo Bay would be because, so long as I have the freedom to walk around, use money, use the Internet, and even hold down jobs, I appear to be as free as a "normal" United States civilian. If I were in a prisoner situation in which I had far less apparent "free will", I would probably default to playing dead while surrendering to being ravished by my environment since resistance would presumably be futile)!

Note: The following description depicts a rather cinematic scene which occurred while I was alone in my motel room a few days ago. After lying down on the bed for a while, I moved my attention away from my upset stomach to my throat which appeared to be frozen in a suppressed gag reflex. What caused me to immediately start gagging and vomiting was the thought that subvocal recognition technology had literally loaded up someone else's speaking style in my throat (and the part of my brain responsible for verbal communication) such that I felt the visceral horror of being infected by a literal parasite of my central nervous system; an entity attempting to hijack my body in order to use it as its host. I thought such a detail needed to be remembered. So here it is recorded!

At all times per day and every day (since February 2019), I have been hearing nonstop vocalized human-sounding messages (spoken in English) which mostly consist of antagonistic messages with no obvious benefit other than to transform my body-mind into a laboratory for government-run mind-control experiments. (I have written about some of the technical aspects of such a phenomenon in the following blog posts: X, Y, Z).

At this point in my life, I feel obliged to plainly describe what I really think of this "auditory harassment".

I think that specific human beings who oversee and direct this "auditory harassment" want me to feel obsolete to society, disposable, maligned or else dismissed as insane and useless by other humans, and tortured to a suicidal extent.

Eventually, dear readers, I will probably end up either committing suicide or else end up involuntarily incarcerated at a mental hospital or prison because the government-implemented "auditory harassment" seems designed to get worse with time rather than easier to live with. Like I said in X, with every one step I take towards completing all of my goals, I seem to get pummeled with enough adversity to amount to approximately five counter steps. I think that the issuers of the "auditory harassment" want me to feel severely punished for doing anything to positively enhance my lifestyle. Instead, what the issuers of the "auditory harassment" want me to do is effectively die (but die in a way that looks like my own doing so that other people do not have to feel culpable).

Not a single human being I have ever known has seriously addressed this matter despite the many times I tried to articulately broach it (both in speaking face-to-face, by phone, and through the medium of blogging). For a while, I thought that a large scale prank was being played on me to see how much bullying in plain sight and in front of seemingly callous humans I could take before having a public meltdown while those humans watch with sadistic glee and call 911 to have me carted away to a cage for at least a week (and probably longer).

"Shut up, do not draw attention to yourself, and just focus on basic survival. Stop trying to be such an overt genius on the Internet. Stop trying to show off (even though you were taught to show off your talents in order to get into prestigious schools and jobs most of your life). Show the people that they need not be so ablist. Show them that talent and intelligence are just elitist baubles. Show them that humility and compassion is all one needs to get by," I imagine the imposers of my "auditory harassment" are essentially trying to get me to conclude. I do not condone such a conclusion. I show off to please myself at the very least.

At the very least, my life is a game of maximizing the intrinsic worth of my own life. No one else can truly take my place in such an endeavor; not even those who remote control and remote view my subjective reality tunnel. Such persons have their own body-minds to contend with. Such people have their own unique time-space allocations to inhabit. (For more elaboration on the topic of non-overlapping personhood, see Y).
