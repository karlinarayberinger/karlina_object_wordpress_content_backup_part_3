<p>TWO_OFFSPRING_MAXIMUM_PER_WOMB</p>
<hr>
<p>As I write this note, I sit in the Dublin/Pleasanton BART parking garage; charging my Android phone and Lenovo (Kubuntu) laptop. Without disclosing the details of my recent experience while traveling from Castro Valley to Dublin/Pleasanton, I feel compelled to do a national president&#8217;s job: define the terms of what I believe is a progressive means to mitigate unsustainable human population growth (within one &#8220;first world&#8221; country).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">After a citizen gives birth to two offspring, that citizen shall be permanently sterilized as soon as possible after its second offspring is born.</span></p>
<p>Such a sterilization procedure is arguably necessary because</p>
<p>(a) Planet Earth already contains more human organisms than it can sustain long-term (which means that the human species will almost certainly go extinct within the next 500 years if the total human population size does not shrink to a more sustainable number),</p>
<p>(b) the current birth-to-death ratio of human organisms is currently too high for Planet Earth can sustain long-term (which means that the human species will almost certainly go extinct within the next 500 years if the birth-to-death ratio of human organisms does not reach a range of equilibrium),</p>
<p>(c) and making it physically impossible for exactly one human womb to give birth to more than exactly two offspring prevents more than one inseminating partner from using that womb to &#8220;cheat&#8221; by using it that womb to yield more than two offspring total prevents citizens from using serial monogamy as an excuse to produce more than their fair share of offspring.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Unlike many Christian types (people who endorse the biblical commandment to &#8220;be fruitful and multiply&#8221; despite the ecological, social, and personal costs), I believe that human reproduction is not the same thing as being a prolific artist. That is because, unlike pieces of intellectual property, human organisms are fragile and needy creatures which each cost a significant amount of resources to properly nurture and maintain (significantly more that static objects).</span></p>
<p>Also, I endorse abortions for first-trimester human fetuses for pregnant humans who want to opt out of incubating that fetus to its birth point (especially if the fetus is severely deformed or if carrying the fetus to term seriously endangers the incubator&#8217;s survival).</p>
<p>If a pregnant human is required to incubate a fetus to its birth point because the fetus appears to be sufficiently healthy and older than three months, the pregnant human may put the offspring up for adoption at any point between the moment the offspring is born and the moment the offspring officially turns 18 years old.</p>
<p>Finally, all minor human organisms should be required to attend public school and be routinely assessed by staff to ensure that the child is not being neglected or abused by its legal guardians. If the child reports that it is being neglected or a<span>&#8221; needless&#8221;=&#8221;&#8221; to=&#8221;&#8221; say,=&#8221;&#8221; both=&#8221;&#8221; children=&#8221;&#8221; and=&#8221;&#8221; adults=&#8221;&#8221; should=&#8221;&#8221; neither=&#8221;&#8221; be=&#8221;&#8221; exploited,=&#8221;&#8221; nor=&#8221;&#8221; neglected,=&#8221;&#8221; abused.</span>bused by its legal guardians and/or the school staff discover that is the case, then the child should be adopted by qualified caregivers and, if necessary, the former legal guardians should be banned from having children.</p>
<p>There is not much more I feel is necessary to say on the matter. Each case will need to be addressed as uniquely situational. The future generations of humanity deserve to be raised in safe and nurturing environments and each child deserves to thrive as optimally as possible (and never be exploited as a human trafficking victim).</p>
<p>&#8220;Needless&#8221; to say, neither children nor adults should be exploited as human trafficking victims, neglect, and/or abuse. (I dread this moralistic tone. It is scientifically atrocious. It is only for poetic flair and little else). Keep profiting on the weak is a method that could always be used. This is a statement that is either true or false. Ambiguity? Words? Necessities?</p>
