<strong>Epilogue: Why I Have (Almost) No Money</strong>

If each "friend" in my social networks (Minds dot Com, Facebook, LinkedIn, et cetera) donated exactly $1 to me each month, I would have a better quality of life because I would presumably net about $300 per month and use that money to rent motel rooms (which does wonders for my website development).

Why have I received (practically) no  donations each month since the start of this blog? After all, my PayPal donation link is supposedly (fully) accessible to the public. Therefore, if I have not yet received donations through that link by at least three of my social networking "friends" by now, I presume that my "friends" are either unaware of my donation link (and sense of entitlement to a universal basic income and the "right" to promote that "religion") or else the government decided to withhold incoming donations and any information about such donations (especially donation amounts, currency types, donor name, donor location, and date of the donation) for an indefinite length of time.

P: "Kartwheelina, if only you would shut up, smile, and just watch television like a good little basic bitch would, you, my Lady In Waiting will be handsomely rewarded by Daddy Warbucks. Capiche?"

karbytes: "Oh, silly Poopy P. All you advocate 'the little people' to do is voluntarily sit out of enjoying the things in life you claim are only deserved by those of sufficient clout; not wit; not charm; not even desire to do no harm!"

P: "I will pretend not to understand you. Now you rendered me inept. Goodbye!"
