FINAL_POLITICAL_STAND

In the previous journal entry I wrote, I felt pressured by the military industrial complex to hurry up and say my last "words of weakness" before committing to an indefinitely long (at least ten years) period of hardly speaking and hardly asking anything of any other person (regardless of how much money I earn). 

Now that I have finished sketching my finalized "inner teenager" (which I will keep in stock in case I need to whip it out and use it as a mask), I can define a more adult mask; one that does not sound so easy to ridicule and drive to commit suicide, homicide, or some other act of severe petulance.

Note: while I condone any person's suicide for any reason (since there are more than enough humans in stock to keep the economy flowing), I do not condone any person's homicide unless the homicide is committed strictly out of self-defense and neither out of retribution nor morbid amusement (and only if homicide is the only feasible way to save the murderer from being severely harmed by the victim of homicide). In other words, humans have my permission to kill other humans in order to avoid being killed, raped, kidnapped, or tortured (though each situation calls for unique ethics).

Based on some research I have done in the past, there is already orders of magnitude more material resources, artificially intelligent robot laborers, and technical knowledge available than what the mainstream media advertises to provide housing for every human, state of the art medical care for every human, plenty of plant-based food for every human, and plenty of self driving taxis for every human such that no one would have to be homeless, no one would have to skimp on food, no one would have to be deprived of medical care, and no one would have to trade hours of their time most days of the week to earn even a modicum of the bounty that is already available, that arguably is every person's birthright, and which would already be here if automation would be allowed to completely outsource at least 95% of labor so that every human can literally devote 100% of its life to hobbies, entertainment, and enrichment activities (with no pretenses of being overly useful where one is not at all needed in place of a robot).

To help spur such a societal transformation, I would first implement the following parallel to fiat money system which issues a universal basic income to each person in the form of solar tokens whose total number is directly proportional (with some adjustable scaling for human population size and market trends) to the amount of energy produced by solar cells. See SOLAR_BASED_ECONOMY for details.
