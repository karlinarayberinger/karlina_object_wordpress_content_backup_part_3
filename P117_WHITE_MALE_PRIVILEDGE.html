WHITE_MALE_PRIVILEDGE

P: "Why are you so damned happy with yourself?"

karbytes: "I have been using an old trick for decades: thinking of my inner self as a white male human no matter how I appear on the outside to other human beings. By thiking of myself as a white male, I do not think of myself as a victim. Instead, I think of myself as the most responsible classification of human. If I complain on my own behalf, my complaints will be ignored at best. If I suffer and make jokes about my suffering AND always keep my focus on ALWAYS solving major societal and personal problems, I tend to feel consistently adequate self esteem."
