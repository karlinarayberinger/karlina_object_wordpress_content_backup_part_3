DESOLATION

<hr>

Approximately eight years ago (back when I was enrolled in college courses, employed as a part-time Google Apps Script writer, and seemingly engaged to be married to my college sweetheart), I distinctly remember creating a YouTube video and webpage tutorial on how to translate binary numbers to decimal numbers and sharing what I created with my father at the kitchen table in my mother's house (back before my father and I were evicted by my mother to live at my father's deceased parents' house instead of my mother's house (because my mother's extramarital affair took precedence over her marriage and because I devolved into a violent and poverty-shocked criminal after all the things that gave me a sense of identity stability and self-esteem pretty much went bye-bye (and my mother wanted to get rid of me once I was no longer a guaranteed shiny piece of socioeconomic status for her to exploit))). Anyway, what I remember not being immediately disturbed by was how my father interruped me in the middle of my spiel to say something like, "You sound smart and all, but all I can concentrate on is how good you look." At that time, I was much better than I am now at suppressing my displeasure. Hence, I was able to take the incident in stride as just another example of how non-geeks are too shallow to appreciate mathematics because they are too myopically focused on posing as models for some all-important audience (because most non-geeks seemed to do little more than practice looking good in front of customers, supervisors, and coworkers in order to receive payment to exist minimally well (and my father's highest level of employment was high-school level at best, so I had patience for his lack of interest in anything other than show biz)).

Flash forward to now...I am horrified at how little I had to call family and friends throughout my entire life. Now that I have had ample time to learn how to live on my own and weather challenges without being overly dramatic and attention-whoring, I am adamant about not regressing back into the kind of social enmeshment I used to be mired in and handicapped by. I am especially horrified by how little compassion my fomer family and friends have shown me. To this day they treat my time like it is absolutely expendible and that my body only has value as a government crash test dummy. To be clear, my former friends and family of origin are too shallow, psychopathic, and dishonest for me to want to live with. That is why I have spent the last few years adapting to living in a state of partial homelessness and nightmarish destitution. My health has suffered and my lifespan is probably shorter than it would have otherwise been if I remained single, finished a college degree, and made career the most important domain of my existence. I failed to be as prescient as I "should" have been. So, according to some people, I "deserve" to suffer poverty and bodily harm as a consequence of not being more devoted to "winning" at the game of capitalism and partaking in the "requisite" cut-throat socioeconomic competitions which treat some persons as more deserving of wellness than others.

"You're smart and all, but you just gotta work harder," AJP told me with a hint of irritability in his voice while we were on our final vacation together at Yosemite National Park in the spring of 2016. His remark was in response to my confessing that I felt that I had to devote more time to building a portfolio of computer science applications to present to prospective employers. If it were that simple to get a decent job, I presumably would have done that a years ago. So why have I not yet delivered the ultimate deliverable: an employment-ready portfolio of front-end web developer project pieces? The reason I have apparently procrastinated for so long is really quite disturbing: my parents were (and still are) my biggest obstacles to me having a career and life outside the home.

Approximately three years ago (back when I spent most of my time isolated in my bedroom at my father's house), I remember my father throwing non-verbal tantrums whenever I focused intently on some computer program I was writing. I tried to make the experience as nice as possible by arranging the furniture and decor in my room to feel uplifing and motivational, listening to classical music on the radio, and taking breaks to go on walks at the nearby Lake Chabot Regional Park so that I had a sense of balance about my full-time "job" as a self-taught programmer and writer. My father's jealousy and extreme narcissism was (and probably still is) so overwhelmingly oppressive to my workflow that I basically have had no choice but to either fall ill and stay practically bedridden, career-adverse, and perpetually miserable at my parents' house(s) or else run away from home and look for other places to build my own life with as little assistance as possible. So far, I have been able to extricate myself from what looks like a deliberate setup by my parents to literally debilitate me such that I would never be able to enjoy a fulfilling career (such that I would stay hidden inside the home as some unloved, useless, and ailing disabled person who would eventually be committed to a mental institution full time).
