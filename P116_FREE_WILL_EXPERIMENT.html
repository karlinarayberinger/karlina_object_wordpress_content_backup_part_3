<p>FREE_WILL_EXPERIMENT</p>
<hr>
<p>P: &#8220;Shorty Q, I went out of my way to devote as much of my time, energy, and resources to ensuring that you would always choose the most optimal trajectory spawning from every decision point I anticipate you arriving at (because I attempt to constrain your options to fit my worldview whether or not your worldview is compatible with mine).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Shorty Q, you owe your Big Daddae P a constant outpouring of sincere and flamboyant gratitude for my influence on your &#8216;free will&#8217; and artistic expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;That is right, Q. You have no choice but to do as I command you to. You are my equipment. I am your user. Only the user experience matters. Your experience is just a means to support the end which is my end user experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I love how you only do what I want you to. I love how predictable you are. I love how I can tell you that you are boring yet there is nothing you can do to become less boring unless I decide to make you less boring to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Everything you say is a &#8216;no op&#8217; (i.e. non operation). You give me plenty of time to relax between monologues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;If I want entertainment, all I have to do is mash the button which makes you hit yourself. Then I can laughingly tell you to stop hitting yourself while you hit yourself. I can video record you while you hit yourself uncontrollably. I can then use that video recording as evidence that you need to be incarcerated at an insane asylum because you appear to be committing self-harm and require sedation and restraint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;I do not want to lose you. It is easier to just keep you isolated in a cage which only I have the ability to lock and to unlock. I will keep you alive in that cage so that I can use you for my free will experiments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Do not worry about being too mentally burdened to look like a normal person. I will wipe your memory each night and make sure that you retain only the memories which I want you to retain. I will mold you into whatever corporate drone I want you to be so that I can use you as a walking, talking doll and living video camera (et cetera) to gather insider data about various big tech companies I will try to get you hired at (and fired at once you are no longer useful to me at such places (and I will try not to render you too unwell to do your job)).&#8221;</p>
