SANTA_RITA_JAIL_NOTES

Note: While taking a shower at this motel room (alone, of course), the following thought occurred:

"Did I intend to kill my mother when I threw the spoon at her? At least one part of me greater than zero said yes. Therefore, the answer to that question might as well be yes."

If the statement above is true (and I, Karlina Ray Beringer, claim it is), then I admit that I am a murderer.

Do I still intend to kill my mother? Not really. Like every other PERSON I ever cared about (for whatever reasons), I do not want any harm to come to it.

To be succinct, I claim that I do not want to kill any PERSON.
