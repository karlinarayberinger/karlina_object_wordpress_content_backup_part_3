After purchasing a plant-based breakfast sandwich, small coffee, and oatmeal from Pete's cafe in Hayward, I decided to follow up on what I said earlier in LIVING_SITUATION_UPDATE with an apologetic note. 

I am sorry for insinuating that places like Hayward are dilapidated and only hospitable to those who make a living from manual labor and human services type jobs. There is a unique and nostalgic charm to such a place. Hayward and California State University East Bay will always have a special place in my heart. This is where I grew up as an adult. I appreciate how kind and diverse people are around here. I really do apologize for over generalizing that no one here cares about computer science, futurism, and science in general. I see that people here are doing their best to appreciate what they have and to help each other like a community should.

Now I am about to change my tone...

There is so much damned garbage piling up in the streets in this place that it is no wonder it has reached a "critical mass" such that it almost looks impossible to clean up (and even if a cleanup crew picked up all the litter and washed away all the barf and poop smears, the trash and bodily excrement will likely pile up again within a few days). That is because this place is densely populated. Therefore, it feels a bit congested and gross. That is why I am hopping on a BART train and heading to Dublin. 

There are software engineering firms out there (which makes me feel less isolated in my career aspirations), a garage with free electrical outlets, and plenty of (relatively clean) sprawling spaces with beautiful views of the mountains on all sides. Perhaps I am simply too "white washed" to genuinely want to root down further in Hayward. Oh well. Time to go where I feel I can best thrive as I truly am. See you on the other side!
