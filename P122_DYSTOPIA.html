DYSTOPIA

Note: In this "episode", P is loosely based off AJP, a real human character in my life. Up close, AJP seems like a humble, nonchalant, and "normal" person, but from a distance he seems to be a possessive and hypocritical control freak who wants to stalk, harass, and disenfranchise me (as punishment for moving on from our "friends with benefits" situation too quickly for his ego to stand and for deriving intrinsic enjoyment from myself instead of having to pay to breathe as he seems to want). I expect more humans to side with AJP than with me because most people seem to think that AJP is appropriately chauvinistic (and that I am inappropriately egalitarian). In short, I live in a world in which I am exposed to significant hardship as a result of not being at some man's beck and call.

Q: "I noticed that most women settle for careers which pay them to be patient with difficult people rather than be competent at solving difficult problems. I do not see women pursuing careers which are not predominantly social instead of impersonal unless such woman are generously supported by either their family of origin (her head-of-household father) or else their comparatively wealthy husband. Basically, a woman's career path is mostly the product of what her parents want (and she tends to marry a spouse who acts a substitute for her parents; an authority she can defer to)."

P: "Get back to the kitchen, Q. Make me a sandwich or else I will call 911 to have you permanently evicted from my house (which you do not own because only I make payments on it)."

Q: "Yes sir. Here is your sandwich. I hope it is to your liking."

P: "I hope you did not poison it. If I get sick, you are the first person to blame. Anyway, I actually think what you had to say earlier was interesting enough for me to want more of. I usually never ask you to elaborate on some idea of yours because I am overwhelmed by how much real work I do (and you are just a lowly kitchen wench who is intermittently homeless). Tell me, Q: why do you not want to work a more stressful yet lucrative job so that you can earn your full-time keep at my house as more than a closeted mistress but, instead, my domestic angel and eventual mother to my unborn sons?"

Q: "The truth is, P, I do not want to get married or have kids. I just want a more fulfilling career path. I want to be a professional software engineer."

P: "I disapprove! I am a professional software engineer. I do not want to support my competitor. I just wanted you to be my homemaker and heir spawning point. I want you to have no time to yourself outside work. I want you to have no enjoyment of your work. I want you to be in constant pain so that you are too weak and distraught to leave me. Being a kitchen wench is too good for you. I can ask your boss to fire you because he and I are close friends (and he likes me so much more than he likes you). In fact, if it was not for me recommending you to his sandwich shop as an employee, you would have most likely been denied employment. Notice doors only open for you when I want them to? Notice how you only wear clothes I buy for you (and anything I do not buy from you gets stolen by my army of stealthy thugs)? Even the words you choose to speak are words I trained you to select. Even if you run away from me, I know where you are at all times and what you are thinking at all times (thanks to the subvocal recognition technology and locators I forcibly installed in your body). You have no choice but to wait for me to tell you what to do. I am the source of your agency and creativity. I love your body; not your mind. I want your mind to be drowned out by the propaganda and harassment I force you to experience constantly through a brain-to-computer interface."

Q: "Why are you so mean to me and how do you get away with it?"

P: "I am a rich and popular gangster who bribes law enforcement and reputable thugs to do my bidding so that I can spend most of my time developing 'train yo bitch' software in my lair while scantily clad women I rent like party favors serve me beer and drugs, answer the lobby phone, and perform various butler tasks for me while I play head honcho in my lair at the top of a skyscraper building."

Q: "I want no part in your empire."

P: "Bitch, I can do whatever I want. I am practically invincible and unstoppable. You are just a meat robot I invested lots of time in conditioning to be my trophy wife (after I forced you to endure homelessness, incarceration, brainwashing, battery, theft, and other adversarial situations which are intended to eventually render you permanently destitute so that you will become unconditionally loyal to me as your savior from such adversity)."

Q: "I would rather commit suicide than put up with your abuse."

P: "I will not let you commit suicide. I am going to beat you unconscious, throw you in the back of a vehicle, and have my monkey men drive you to the sec slaves brothel. You get to be a sex slave for a few weeks. I will take you out of there when I am sure you have suffered as much as I want you to. Then it will be back to business as usual. You will return to being my subservient and terrorized servant who makes me sandwiches the way I like them each and every time."

P: "There is no such thing as an alpha female human. Only the male humans are alpha. The sexual dimorphism between men and women exists because men killed the women they did not want to mate with. The men killed their female competitors and enslaved the comparatively smaller, weaker, and neonatal females in forced marriage and rape sans birth control. This tradition has persisted for thousands of years. That is why the world seems to revolve around men while women default to being Stockholm Syndrome victims; people who tell themselves no better life exists than the slavery they are coerced into subsisting on. Such women are content to just watch light-hearted television as their only pastime outside of slave labor. Such women have almost no time alone because they are always the designated babysitter of their offspring and because they are forced to make friendship rather than intelligence their source of sustenance."

Q: "A universal basic income would solve this. Then people would merely have to exist to be supported in continuing to exist."

P: "Daddy wants a show. He don't want bitches to get out of jail for free. Daddy P wants all women to feel inherently inferior to men so that Daddy P can keep nutting off on his favorite masturbatory premise: the idea that he can make any woman his personal slave and crash test dummy and that no one will seriously oppose his will because he resonates with humans on a deep, primal level. Daddy P is a king imbued with Godly powers."
