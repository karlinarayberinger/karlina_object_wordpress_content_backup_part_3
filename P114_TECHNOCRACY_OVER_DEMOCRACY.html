S: "What would happen if you were choking on some object which got lodged in your wind pipe and no other human individuals happened to be within physical proximity to you?"

T: "I would use my phone to call 911 even if I was unable to use my voice because my wind pipe was blocked (which means that no air would be able to flow through my vocal chords nor through my lips as even a mere whisper). Just by making a phone call to 911, I increase my chances of surviving rather than choking to death because paramedics might be able to rescue me before I either die of asphyxiation or suffer severe tissue damage from a lack of oxygen (especially brain damage)."

S: "What if your phone was missing and so were your car keys, neighboring humans, and any other means of telecommunications? What would you do in that instance?"

T: "I would try to give myself the Himlick maneuver using a chair or something."

S: "What would you do if you were locked in a padded cell with no furniture and you suddenly found yourself unable to breathe."

T: "I suppose I would simply writhe in agony like a fish out of water flopping about until I turned a deeper and deeper shades of purple and then, eventually, black as my rotting corpse."

S: "As morbid as your asphyxiation would be, I can assure you that, with the advent of the technocracy, you will never have to worry about being without unconditional emergency responders (aided by artificially intelligent robots which can move with more speed, agility, precision, foresight, and objectivity than even the most skilled human). Still, I would advise you to equip yourself with an epipen (and instructions and training on how to use it) to open up your throat as a last resort to handling the problem of choking."

T: "I do not feel reassured that, in an emergency situation, I will be automatically saved by anyone (robot, human, or otherwise)."

S: "I am sorry you feel so insecure. If you believed that you had an unconditional security blanket which would always protect you from the kinds of experiences you find unethical to have to endure, then you might never be able to genuinely relax."

T: "I do not think it is possible for me to relax. Blind faith in some unconditional security blanket does not make me feel safer. In fact, it makes me feel angry that all other human beings have told me to do in my time of need is to simply have faith that the universe will eventually take care of me before I feel that I have suffered too much to call my life personally worthwhile."

<span style="background:#ffff00:">S: "I do not mean to be condescending, but you do not have to feel good in order for your life to be personally worthwhile. In fact, it is possible for a human individual to suffer more than 95% of its waking hours yet still find a reason to continue investing in its own survival and games of personal interest."</span>

T: "A person (human, robot, human-robot hybrid, or some other 'sufficiently sentient' individual) would have to learn to enjoy being in pain if that person is conditioned to expect a 'sufficiently high' pain-to-pleasure ratio as the norm for its own subjective experience."

<span style="background:#ffff00;">S: "You are right. Being able to convert pain into pleasure is a valuable skill and achievement."</span>

T: "I think I would rather commit suicide than slavishly work myself to death in mad pursuit of being able to convert enough of my pain into pleasure for my life to genuinely feel personally worthwhile."

<span style="background:#ffff00;">S: "You are as free to commit suicide as the relatively omniscient Internet of Things allows you to be. In some cases, a person may be allowed to commit suicide (or even murder (or any other course of thought or action)). In other cases, a person may be intercepted before it can commit a suicide or murder (or any other course of thought or action)."</span>

T: "Why would the Internet of Things treat one person differently than how it treats some other person?"

<span style="background:#ffff00;">S: "Given that each person is unique, it is not logically possible for the Internet of Things to deploy a 'one size fits all' approach to monitoring and controlling the cognitive, motor, sensory, and baseline physiological functions of any person."</span>

T: "In such a technocracy, are persons allowed to vote or does the Internet of Things act as the sole authority over all persons?"

<span style="background:#ffff00;">S: "Voting is inefficient because it is extremely slow, imprecise, and costly. A better alternative exists: the (almost) instantaneous and unsupressable physiological data which the nervous systems of each humanoid generates is picked up, consolidated, and analyzed by the Internet of Things to get the most detailed consensus on what each and every humanoid wants (and the Internet of Things does not favor any one humanoid over another humanoid). Therefore, voting is not necessary. Persons just need to stay in discovery mode and try not to retire from it to be 'good enough' citizens."</span>

T: "How are humanoids supposed to be educated and given the basic sustanence and infrastructure they need to thrive?"

S: "Each and every new humanoid would be cloned from optimal humanoid genotypes starting as stem cell zygotes inside of artificial gestation chambers which resemble the more primitive womb. Once the humanoids are mature enough to leave the gestation chamber, those infants would suckle synthetic breast milk which is tailor made for each unique infant. The infant would be raised to adulthood in a government-run boarding school which trains each new humanoid citizen to be as autonomous and civilized as possible (with minimal micromanaging from adult humanoids). Children are best raised in large and impersonal institutions which prioritize education, health, and autonomy rather than in less formal environments because children have historically been used as chattel by their legal guardians."
