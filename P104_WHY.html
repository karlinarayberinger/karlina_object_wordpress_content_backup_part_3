Today I went to Whole Foods in Dublin, California (after spending the night at the nearby Motel 6) and bought a gourmet cup of coffee for only $3. Then I went to the nearby Barnes & Noble to buy a collector's hard cover edition of (The Illustrated) A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell (two books in one) by Stephen Hawking. 

I bought the book because it seems to be the perfect antidote to all that religious crap (new age, Eastern religion, and the Koran included) which I would "normally" waste my time and energy on as I struggle to cherry pick the most salient bits of scripture from an "appropriately" diverse range of religious and self-help texts to use as the input "seed" for generating my own (absolutely perfect) religious text.

Now that I am no longer as naive as the sophomore I used to be, I now see much deeper into what I used to get carried away with at a comparatively superficial level of understanding. Now I see Jesus Christ as a trope for why sacrificial murder is in vain and how Stephen Hawking attempted to transcend his body's mortality and limitations by inquiring deeply into how black holes work and by communicating his understandings in a user-friendly book. It is like having a friend I can relate to on a deep and timeless level which I can carry with me in my backpack so that, at "random" times, I can take the book out of the "shelf" and look inside it for just a "hit" of inspiration.
