<p>SUICIDE_ENDORSEMENT</p>
<hr>
<p>This note is intended for AJP and any other person:</p>
<p>I, Karlina Ray Beringer (karbytes), give you permission to end your life (but not by intentionally inflicting harm on other persons (e.g. suicide bombing such that your suicide endangers the safety and functioning of other persons besides yourself). I do not apologize for influencing your decision to either live or else plot your own death. I would celebrate the death of AJP. I think such a person has outlived its usefulness and is now more of a source of suffering than a source of benefit.</p>
<p>Whoever you are, if you sincerely desire to commit suicide, I sincerely and exuberantly congratulate your brave and generous decision to relieve the living of what a miserable burden you are. Farewell and good riddance forever! Be sure to leave a suicide note on the Internet. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Even the worst persons deserve (in my opinion) to create and preserve an immortal record of its creative outpourings on the public Internet as a cultural and forensic artifact.</span></p>
