<p>CURING_POVERTY_AND_OVERPOPULATION</p>
<hr>
<p>As far as I have been able to discern, the more a person deliberately tries to be virtuous (or the more a person deliberately tries to be non-virtuous), the more that person seems uncomfortably inauthentic. (Those who try to appear non-virtuous typically do so because they want to earn the approval of people who seem to promote the idea that being nonchalant, insensitive, rowdy, lewd, unsentimental, and non-serious is &#8220;cooler&#8221; than wanting to adhere to relatively &#8220;chaste&#8221; standards of conduct).</p>
<p>What I am physically unable to continue tolerating is holding onto insincere emotions in my body. I used to either numb myself out to the point that I knew I appeared to be an unkind asshole towards other people (but deep on the inside I felt like a small child in pain wanting to be carried home). When I turned my attention inward towards that child who needed my kindness, people outside of me would try to get me to &#8220;snap out of it&#8221; and get back to being a fake clown for their benefit exclusively. Such people have been so exhausting to put up with that I literally got adrenal fatigue and a violent stomach flu that forced me to go on a motel retreat to escape the nonstop succession of painful stimuli coming from the outside in. (I am making plans to stay away from the public eye and from family members I would normally live with so that I can continue to actually feel out what my actual authentic thoughts and feelings are without the manipulative meddling of others who seem to have no respect for who I am as a unique person and not just some tool to help them feel comparatively cool or virtuous. I know there are several places I can &#8220;camp&#8221; with my laptop, backpack, and gear where I will not have to suffer in the outdoor elements, automobile exhaust, and micromanagerial people).</p>
<p>In two previous blog posts, <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/mandatory_social_friction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MANDATORY_SOCIAL_FRICTION</a> and <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/benevolent_murder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BENEVOLENT_MURDER</a>, I stated that I would sentence both of my parents to being quickly and painlessly murdered. At the time of writing, I felt that quickly and painlessly killing them would net significantly less harm than allowing them to continue living. After taking two days to reflect on the matter, I see that I really do not want to kill anyone unless such a person wants to be killed (and I would want to kill that person in as painless of a method as possible because <span style="background:#ffff00;">I believe that suicide should be legal and unconditionally accessible via physician assisted means</span>). I have spent so much time alone that I now feel like a real hermit; someone who feels connected to all the humans but from a relatively impersonal (and, hence, relatively egalitarian) stance. I do not think of my family or friends as any more or less significant than strangers. That is no exaggeration. I think that is a significant part of why I am not as corrupt as I used to be.</p>
<p>Back when I used to only have a romantic partner to accommodate and to depend on for almost all of my survival needs, I acted like a demonically possessed person; someone I despised and thought was an ugly parasite and bad example to humanity (especially to young girls). As long as I had my romantic partner, I could blissfully ignore all phenomena outside my imaginary bubble of matrimonial ensconcement. Once I got used to being single for the rest or my life, I realized that I never really wanted to be so easy to engulf and leave destitute once the relationship inevitably ended. I seriously think I was conned into settling for shitty relationships due to economics more than any other factor. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Until there is a universal basic income in place, I doubt that human relationships can be as wholesome as I want them to be.</span> Therefore, I would rather stay hermetic than to gravitate towards relationships which revolve around policing each other&#8217;s abundance. (To see my mathematically sound and ecologically sustainable model for implementing a universal basic income, see <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_based_economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLAR_BASED_ECONOMY</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;about murdering people&#8230;</p>
<p>Would I choose to kill any human who is not suicidal? I would rather knock that person temporarily unconscious and have that person incarcerated and intensively analyzed to figure out how to either rehabilitate that person so that it can return to &#8220;normal&#8221; society or else stay isolated away from &#8220;normal&#8221; society in a humane maximum security prison.</p>
<p>What about overpopulation? Of course, there are already too many humans on Planet Earth. What about life extending technologies which enable individual humans to survive for hundreds if not thousands of years per lifetime? <span style="background:#ffff00;">I vehemently would demand that all new born humans be sterilized at birth and that new humans be born inside of laboratories which use computer-generated genotypes to implant inside of human stem cell gametes which then become zygotes which are incubated in an artificial womb for approximately nine months before being raised to adulthood in state-operated nurseries and boarding schools</span> to avoid the familial cultural poisoning which caused the vast majority of human civilization&#8217;s malaise: the enslavement of children by their elders, the corruption of otherwise genius minds by intellectually incompetent legal guardians, and the traumatization of impressionable youth due to unnecessary exposure to adult hostility and unprofessional conduct. The state-run boarding schools eliminate most of the developmental obstacles which selfish parents typically impose on their offspring. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I do not think parenthood is an unalienable right the way free speech is.</span> Bitches need to stop living vicariously through their crotch fruit!</p>
<p>I have very little sympathy for incompetent parents (*). I would have their kids whisked away to a better living situation if I had that kind of executive power. No I do not want to raise someone else&#8217;s kid. Instead, I implore professionally trained boarding school staff and artificial intelligence to collaboratively raise the future generations of humans such that overpopulation is effectively mitigated and so that no child is left destitute.</p>
<p>(*) <span style="background:#ffff00;">Of course I want to minimize the suffering of all people (excluding no one).</span> I am not a mean-spirited person. I just sometimes sound like I am just to communicate that I am tired of being wounded the same way multiple times (especially when one time is unnecessary).</p>
