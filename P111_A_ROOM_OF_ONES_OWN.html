A_ROOM_OF_ONE'S_OWN

<hr>

For five nights (including tonight and not including that one night I went back to "Hi Town"), I have stayed in a heavenly Motel 6 near the Dublin BART station to so some of the deepest "shadow work" of my life (and "shadow work" is an informal name for introspective activities which involve facing and overcoming personal psychological (and psychosomatic) challenges (which are colloquially referred to as "inner demons")). I must say that I have never felt better than I do now at any point in my past. Having my own temporary place of residence where I have an almost distraction-free environment and place to relax, take a shower, work on my laptop, and simply meditate has done wonders to help replenish my "soul" after years of running around like an anxious (and stupid) chicken in an ongoing, high-stress, low-fun "game" of hide-and-go seek with people in general. 

For most of my twenties (and some of my thirties), my life has felt like some kind of movie for other people to watch while I merely adhere to some watered down script and wait for the comparatively important characters to arrive. It is like living as a background character in your own life while the other significant characters of your life imply that the main character of your life has yet to arrive because you have not done enough to accommodate that anticipated character's arrival and central importance as the sun which you revolve around like a comparatively miniscule planet. In short, because I decided to make my life a play about a hermetic geek on a quest to resolve its existential angst (instead of a generic heterosexual romance template which demands that I get married to some Very Important Man who I am supposed to give up my independence and individuality for in exchange for being a resident at His house (and usually with the implied demand that I birth as many of His babies as He wants me to)), I have been treated by potential suitors (i.e. those vying to become the one and only Very Important Man of my life) and by people who seem to want me to get swallowed whole and digested beyond recognition by such a Very Important Man as a delinquent. "You need to comply with what We demand because only He can redeem you wayward shrew and wicked witch. It's time to leave the forest. It's time to say goodbye to your feline friends. It's time to learn how to soothe babies suck cocks to perfection. Grow some tits while you are at it. You need more flesh to define your subdued womanliness," such people seem to sneeringly say to me. (I happen to enjoy having almost non-existent hits and a healthily thin body shape (like a typical Asian). I think Americans are gross about how they insist that woman pack on way more fat than necessary just to please some heterosexual man (or brow-beaten, commercialized lesbian)).

So tonight (and today) I get to be alone in my motel room to do as I please. I would rather work on my website by myself than be used as a sex toy for some toad guy who is all about "shut up and let the television do the talking" when His dick is not the featured subject of His (and therefore my) movie. Remember: I am in my own movie as the one and only protagonist. Other people come and go. Only I stay.
