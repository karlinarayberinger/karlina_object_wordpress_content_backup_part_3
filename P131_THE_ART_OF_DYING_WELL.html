<p>THE_ART_OF_DYING_WELL</p>
<hr>
<p>Across the past few weeks, I have suffered one painful physical ailment after another. Just when one injury or illness seemed to be getting better, a new one started such that there was no gap of &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in between. Perhaps, as I get older and my body (and surrounding planetary ecosystem) give way to increasing entropy, the frequency and severity of my physical ailments will &#8220;inevitably&#8221; worsen.</p>
<p>Ten years ago (when I as 21 years old), I was freshly inspired by futurist philosophy and the idea that technology will ultimately cure virtually all of humanity&#8217;s obstacles towards extending human lifespans, physiological capacities, and depth of enjoyment of all reality has to offer. Now that I am 31 years old, I see that the technological singularity (the point in time in which artificial intelligence becomes at least as conscious and capable as unaugmented human beings are), still seems likely to occur during my lifetime (probably when I am close to 60 or 70 years old). Despite human civilization&#8217;s technological prowess and the bounty it could provide for all people, what I fear more than ever is that elitists will &#8220;inevitably&#8221; hoard most of that bounty while poor people will be deprived of such things as revolutionary medical treatment which could extend their lifespans and quality of experience significantly.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">In addition to the wealthiest elites hoarding most of the bounty, I fear that there is too much complacency in the comparatively poorer (and less educated) human population such that there simply is not a strong enough &#8220;critical mass&#8221; of people who are seriously devoted to making futuristic ideals come to fruition.</span> Hence, there is a probability greater than zero that the complacency and unintelligence of the masses will delay or prevent humanity from reaching its next step of evolution; the step in which no person is deprived of the right to survive well for thousands of years, be equipped with prosthetics, and generally experience a quality of life that makes so-called modern life seem barbaric and antiquated in comparison (almost to the point of not being worth living for).</p>
<p>I am writing this piece because I there is a probability greater than zero that my personal suffering will &#8220;inevitably&#8221; worsen with age to the extent that I will be in significantly more pain than otherwise. <span style="background:#ffff00;">A high pain-to-pleasure ratio is not necessarily cause for me to want to end my life early via suicide, but it certainly compels me to want to make learning to cope with suffering a high priority (if not my highest priority).</span></p>
<p>Several years ago, I would have been disgusted with myself for suggesting that I make learning to cope with pain my highest aspiration in life. Back then, I thought I needed to prove to humanity what a genius I am. I thought I had to accomplish impressive feats which would make me famous, wealthy, and appreciated by many people. Now I am more modest about what I expect to accomplish with the life I have remaining (and there is no guarantee that I will survive to an &#8220;old&#8221; age since I could die at any time due to unprecedented events).</p>
<p>So, my &#8220;official new religion&#8221; to adopt today is The Art Of Dying Well. What the hell does that mean? Well, it means that I should strive to live a minimalist life in which I do my best to mitigate my harmful impact on the ecosystem (since <span style="background:#ffff00;">I feel spiritually connected to Nature in ways that supersede all human-to-human connections</span> and I see how little humans generally appreciate being connected to Nature on a deep and personal level (which would inevitably make such persons want to consciously practice sustainable living)). To die well is to live one day at a time as though each day is one&#8217;s last. To die well is to make life an ongoing practice of learning to surrender to reality because resistance to reality is futile (and humans are not the ultimate authorities on what constitutes reality).</p>
<p>In practical terms, I intend to settle for more modest personal goals than the ones I used to think I had to accomplish in order to feel that I have earned my own approval (and the approval of other people). Now I see that my former ambitions were insidiously greedy of my vitality. Nothing I did was ever good enough and rarely appreciated for more than a fleeting and lukewarm moment of acknowledgement. I see that my former &#8220;super ego&#8221; was a harsh critic who could never be satisfied and who always berated me despite my best efforts to please it. That is why I am no longer content to live for the approval and accolades of humans in general. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Human society (currently) seems set up to keep people frenetically chasing after superficial rewards while destroying the planet and their bodies.</span> I would rather settle for a gentler approach (even if other people think I have gone insane or lack praiseworthy qualities).</p>
<p>One last thing: I strongly recommend the practice of spending time doing unstructured meditation in which one lets thoughts flow naturally. Not only does this help one become more aligned with Nature, on a more pragmatic level, making time each day to &#8220;do nothing&#8221; so that the mind can do whatever it wants while the body rests allows the mind to process junk that would otherwise be hogging cognitive resources. <span style="background:#ffff00;">In some ways, meditation is like defragmenting the hard drive of a digital computer in order to make the computer function more optimally.</span></p>
