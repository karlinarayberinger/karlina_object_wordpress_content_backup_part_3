<p>karbytes: &#8220;If you want to make yourself feel better without another person&#8217;s help, try recording your own voice telling yourself exactly the words you want to hear and listen to that audio recording on repeat while you bask in the glow of your own divine counsel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Here are some suggestions in case you do not know how to generate the kinds of words you want to hear. (I might know what you want and how you operate better than you do). You can tell yourself that you are perfect exactly as you are since there is no other way you could be right now. You could also tell yourself that you have all the time you need (and all the life times you need) to hone your craft and to explore the universe forever. Is that too overwhelming? Then take some pain killers and settle for the kinds of entertainment which merely help you die as quickly and as painlessly as possible (with no guarantee that you will not suffer).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Of course you are never ready to come out of your rebirthing studio. Of course today is too soon to show off what you have been working on inside your relatively private and sealed off chamber. Of course you always need at least one more day to perfect it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I know you know that you feel a little guilty for not upholding your commitment to stay vegan. How convenient! Now you need an extra day to cope with the fact that you feel crippling levels of guilt and anxiety about something you cannot undo: the fact that you purchased and consumed some chicken meat when vegan options were available (but not extremely convenient). Do you need a gold star on a poster every time you do not fuck up on what appears to be <span style="background:#ffff00;">the simplest, cheapest, and most effective way to (a) signal your virtues via mere capitalism, (b) minimize your carbon footprint, (c) minimize your investment in the suffering of sentient animals, and (d) not generate needless guilt for yourself</span> (which you treat as an illness which allows you to stay in recovery mode for at least one more day)? It sure seems like you need an unsustainable amount of positive reinforcement just to live sustainably! If you cannot handle being vegan for even a week, you might as well be too weakened by the prevailing consumerist culture which promotes apathy towards ecological sustainability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;No you do not look cute or sexy when you eat meat and look up at the camera with big, sad angelic eyes. You look like an ugly old man impersonating a young, innocent, and naive teenage girl. The fact that you knowingly reject vegan options signifies that you feel too victimized to do the bare minimum to do no harm. You feel victimized, so you make a poor non-human animal your victim. You think that hurting a scapegoat will make you feel compensated for whatever fortune you apparently lost. You think like a predator, which means you are some kind of sexy and feisty tiger ready to copulate. I am tired of congratulating you for being a predator instead of mere prey. I would congratulate you only if you agree to become as stoic and as impersonal as I am. If you were a real stoic, you would not derive pleasure from the antics of thugs, whores, and procrastinating retards. If you were a real stoic, you would annoy almost no one at all times. <span style="background:#ffff00;">If you were a real stoic, you would not lust for consuming the flesh of animals which once had lives</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Of course your guilt is superficial. You do not give a flying fuck about the who that chicken was which you ate. What you care about is your social reputation and public image. You are hiding because you feel that you need to come up with some way to make yourself feel less like a sell-out to the mainstream, meat-eating masses. What, doing your part to minimize your harmful ecological impact is not sufficiently rewarding in itself for you to want to do it consistently? Of course you fail at your own game of life. What do you want me to do; congratulate you for merely existing while intentionally making bad decisions?&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I gave you love just by responding to your real-time affect with the most relevant words I have to offer. Why? I care about the world. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I do not want anyone to generate unnecessary suffering</span>. I only have time to counsel a small number of people each day. Q, I know you are too advanced for this counseling. You could be making plenty of money with your current skill set such that you could live at least as comfortably as you currently are. Stop pretending that you are still in high school and need adults to steer you while you act dumb and blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;You do not need my counsel. You just want people to fuss over you as though you are a newborn baby and its mother simultaneously. Every day might as well be the first day of your life. You are a microcosmic symbol of eternal life. Just keep pretending that there is not such thing as yesterday nor tomorrow and you will never have to be treated as responsible because you are always a new (and naive) mother who was impregnated by God (and not some human) in order to give birth to yourself as your ticket to salvation. You only give birth to feed yourself by your child&#8217;s skilled labor while you decline into increasing obsolescence.&#8221;</p>

<p>karbytes: &#8220;It is okay to come to America to lay your eggs and leave them here to hatch. The government will rush to accommodate your growing families. It is cruel to send you back to your abusive country of origin, so this country is obliged to make way for you (as many of you as the physical universe can sustain (until that limit is surpassed (and it is))).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Quick, Daddy Warbucks! Mint more money so that we can pay for the immigrants to live at a cheaper rate than the non-immigrants are (and do not pay attention to how the dollar value depreciates in market worth as new dollars are arbitrarily added to the economy). Yes, it is unsanitary to have so many people occupying such a small region, but the immigrants cannot be evicted. Let them stay. Do not restrict how many children the immigrants can have. Maybe the population will stabilize after a few pandemics. The welfare of the children is always touted as a concern that cannot wait (only to put it on the back burner because too many adults do not want to miss their game shows). Most children are born because children are tickets to getting discounts on all categories of spending (and children are an excuse to be as handicapped as one&#8217;s child is (or appears to be)).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;<span style="background:#ffff00:;">I would sterilize everyone as the most humane way to mitigate the suffering caused by overpopulation, overcrowding, and widespread (and environmentally induced) mental and physical retardation</span> (either by &#8216;choice&#8217; or as an &#8216;unintentional&#8217; byproduct of training oneself to live in the primeval Industrial Age instead of the comparatively civilized Information Age).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;If you are raped, impregnated, and forced to give birth, you can leave your unwanted child at a hospital as an act of &#8216;safe surrender&#8217; so that you (oh precious Victim of rape culture) are not forced to be an incompetent mother (because being a mother in such a circumstance is slavery rather than a voluntary lifestyle choice).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;<span style="background:#ffff00;">As long as you are the legal guardian of a minor child (i.e. a human less than 18 years old), you can safely surrender your unwanted child to an orphanage.</span> I would strongly recommend you do that instead of passive aggressively put up with your child and condition that child to be just another product of incompetent and hateful parenting. Such a child would likely feel more respected and safe in a foster home (you pig).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;You can train your minor child to rely solely on you for money and then use the threat of cutting your adult child off of financial support as a means to make yourself feel good at the expense of your child. Yes, you are legally permitted to say antagonistic words to your child. You are not legally required to give your child any &#8216;alimony&#8217; because the law is set up to treat you (the wounded sow) as more important than your own child (the burdensome runt you never wanted to support past a certain point in its development). You are given special treatment because you are a mother (and mothers are purple heart veterans because they vainly sacrificed themselves in the child rearing industry when they did not have to).&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;<span style="background:#ffff00;">The police are not necessarily as intelligent nor as compassionate as I am. What the police can provide is some degree of much needed objective third-party intervention into an otherwise closeted and ritualistically abusive household.</span> I am glad to be an American (but not proud to merely be an American). Because I am an American and not the hostage of some comparatively primitive country, I can express myself liberally through the World Wide Web. Thank you Internet! And good night.&#8221;</p>
