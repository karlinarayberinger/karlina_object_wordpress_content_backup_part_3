My <strong>enemies</strong> are persons who apparently enjoy my suffering and who deliberately attempt to induce a significant portion of my future suffering.

I do believe that the adage, <strong>"friends are known enemies"</strong>, is generally applicable to each and every human-to-human relationship.

Some people genuinely want to alleviate the collective suffering of human civilization. Such a feat is functionally invalid unless absolutely zero individual persons are excluded.
