<p>WHITE_MALE_PRIVILEGE</p>
<hr>
<p>P: &#8220;Why are you so damned happy with yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I have been using an old trick for decades: thinking of my personal humanoid ego (i.e. mind) as a white male human no matter how my body appears to other human beings. <span style="background:#ffff00;">By thinking of myself as a white male human, I think of myself as someone who is never allowed to identify as a victim (and that is a wonderful thing because it means that I do not have to waste time pretending to be &#8216;appropriately offended&#8217; by experiences which I find personally upsetting (because wallowing in prolonged distress is a waste of my precious finite attention span, opportunities, energy, and other coveted resources which are in limited supply)).</span> Instead, I think of myself as the most responsible classification of human (according to what most human beings seem to subconsciously agree on since that is what the mainstream culture has promoted (and white male privilege is a result of Europeans acquiring guns and immunity to disease faster than competing human lineages have (which means that, like it or not, white males tend to be represented as the default and ideal human prototype in the collective human subconscious)). If I complain on my own behalf, my complaints will be ignored (by most humans) at best. If I suffer and make jokes about my suffering (rather than show signs of distress) AND <span style="background:#ffff00;">always keep my focus on solving what I think are the most significant societal and personal problems, I tend to feel consistently adequate self esteem because I think of myself as a problem solver; not a mere consumer</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;You are a nazi. Therefore, you deserve to be the victim of terrorism inflicted upon you by diversity quota enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;What do you mean by punishment? What do you mean by diversity quota enforcement?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;By punishment, I mean coordinating people to stand by with their attack dogs ready to maul you when you appear to be entering community spaces which are primarily enjoyed by people who are not white male humans at times you are decidedly a threat to the status quo (and the status quo is that you are too racist to want to be friends with anyone except for white males (so, if you show up where white males are not expected to hang out, then you are acting &#8216;socially inappropriate&#8217; as a token nazi caricature and scapegoat for the comparatively destitute peoples to metaphorically barf into from a good safe distance and such that you appear to be in a place where your body is not publicly visible)). Of course, there are a myriad of subtle and not-so-subtle ways you can be punished. The more you deviate from sheltered and naive token nazi scapegoat caricature you are commanded to be (for the sake of appeasing the conceit of the minorities), the more likely you will be punished by the undercover social justice league.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;What do you mean by diversity quota enforcement?&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Diversity quota is an arbitrary set of percentages which each add up to 100% and which each represent some natural number percentage for how much a specific ethnic group is supposed to comprise the total population. Hiring managers are required to hire and fire people such that the respective company reflects that arbitrary breakdown of ethnic proportions.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I see. It seems like I get called a nazi mostly because I would rather invest in becoming a software developer full time than work as a customer service representative or manual labor worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;You must keep your ambitions a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I do not think that is possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;You are right. Then you might as well continue being the token bigot at whatever company you next get hired at (if you get hired at all).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I am still planning on defaulting to going back to warehouse work (particularly at Tesla Motors in Fremont, California no later than 01_JULY_2021) if living off the tepid stream of donations I currently receive does not satisfy me by the time I am eligible for rehire at Tesla.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Do not even talk about jobs or money in front of any embodied human. Such topics make people get all riled up. Do not wake the sleeping babes.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">karbytes: &#8220;Okay. I will play dumb and let people accuse me of playing dumb or of actually being dumb. Meanwhile, I will do my best to not be dumb on the inside.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>P: &#8220;That&#8217;s my boy!&#8221;</p>
