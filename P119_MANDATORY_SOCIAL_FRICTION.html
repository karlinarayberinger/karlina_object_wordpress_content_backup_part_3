karbytes: "If you want to make yourself feel better without another person's help, try recording your own voice telling yourself exactly the words you want to hear and listen to that audio recording on repeat while you bask in the glow of your own divine counsel."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "Here are some suggestions in case you do not know how to generate the kinds of words you want to hear. (I might know what you want and how you operate better than you do). You can tell yourself that you are perfect exactly as you are since there is no other way you could be right now. You could also tell yourself that you have all the time you need (and all the life times you need) to hone your craft and to explore the universe forever. Is that too overwheliming? Then take some pain killers and settle for the kinds of entertainment which merely help you die as quickly and as painlessly as possible (with no guarantee that you will not suffer)."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "Of course you are never ready to come out of your rebirthing studio. Of course today is too soon to show off what you have been working on inside your relatively private and sealed off chamber. Of course you always need at least one more day to perfect it."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "I know you know that you feel a little guilty for not upholding your commitment to stay vegan. How convenient! Now you need an extra day to cope with the fact that you feel crippling levels of guilt and anxiety about something you cannot undo: the fact that you purchased and consumed some chicken meat when vegan options were available (but not extremely convinient). Do you need a gold star on a poster every time you do not fuck up on what appears to be the simplest, cheapest, and most effective way to (a) signal your virtues via mere capitalism, (b) minimize your carbon footprint, (c) minimize your investment in the suffering of sentient animals, and (d) not generate needless guilt for yourself (which you treat as an illness which allows you to stay in recovery mode for at least one more day)."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "Of course your guilt is superficial. You do not give a flying fuck about the who that chicken was which you ate. What you care about is your social reputation and public image. You are hiding because you feel that you need to come up with some way to make yourself feel less like a sell-out to the mainstream, meat-eating masses. What, doing your part to minimize your harmful ecological impact is not sufficiently rewarding in itself for you to want to do it consistently? Of course you fail at your own game of life. What do you want me to do; congratulate you for merely existing while intentionally making bad decisions?"

Q: "..."

karbytes: "I gave you love just by responding to your real-time affect with the most relevant words I have to offer. Why? I care about the world. I do not want anyone to generate unnecessary suffering. I only have time to counsel a small number of people each day. Q, I know you are too advanced for this counseling. You could be making plenty of money with your current skill set such that you could live at least as comfortably as you currently are. Stop pretending that you are still in high school and need adults to steer you while you act dumb and blind."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "You do not need my counsel. You just want people to fuss over you as though you are a newborn baby and its mother simultaneously. Every day might as well be the first day of your life. You are a microsmic symbol of eternal life. Just keep pretending that there is not such thing as yesterday nor tomorrow and you will never have to be treated as responsible because you are always a new (and naive) mother who was impregnated by God (and not some human) in order to give birth to yourself as your ticket to salvation. You only give birth to feed yourself by your child's skilled labor while you decline into increasing obsolecense."

karbytes: "It is okay to come to America to lay your eggs and leave them here to hatch. The government will rush to accomodate your growing families. It is cruel to send you back to your abusive country of origin, so this country is obliged to make way for you (as many of you as the physical universe can sustain (until that limit is surpassed (and it is)))."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "Quick, Daddy Warbucks! Mint more money so that we can pay for the immigrants to live at a cheaper rate than the non-immigrants (and do not pay attention to how the dollar value depreciates in value as dollars are arbitrarily added to the economy). Yes, it is unsanitary to have so many people occupying such a small region, but the immigrants cannot be evicted. Let them stay. Do not restrict how many children the immigrants can have. Maybe the population will stabilize after a few pandemics. The welfare of the children is always a concern. Most children are born because children are tickets to getting discounts on all categories of spending (and children are an excuse to be as handicapped as one's child is (or appears to be))."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "I would sterilize everyone as the most humane way to mitigate the suffering caused by overpopulation, overcrowding, and widespread mental and physical retardation (either by choice or as an unintentional byproduct of training oneself to live in the Industrial Age instead of the Information Age)."

Q: "..."

karbytes: "If you are raped, impregnated, and forced to give birth, you can leave your unwanted child at a hospital as an act of 'safe surrender' so that you (oh precious Victim of rape culture) are not forced to be an incompetent mother."
