<p>Note: The best page (in my opinion) which I have written thus far is <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_based_economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLAR_BASED_ECONOMY</a>, a technical document introducing an ecologically-sustainable and mathematically-sound system for implementing a universal basic income using currency derived from actual photovoltaic cell (i.e. solar cell) electrical output.</p>

<p>After walking around with my shirt off and my pants rolled up to the knees in the flats near Dublin/Pleasanton BART station, I started feeling much better than I did earlier today. I felt that I had room to breathe more freely, move more freely, and relax in a more spacious and naturalistic environment than the claustrophobic urban center where I usually hang out. I saw minnows swimming in a school in a shallow creek and Canadian geese standing in a large green field. The breeze and warm sunlight felt good against my pallid skin.</p>
<p>After walking around for a bit, I decided to place an order for some Protab Cold Water Hash Sativa tablets from the most local cannabis store for approximately $35: Garden of Eden on the border of Hayward and Castro Valley. I am going to walk back to the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station, board the train, and get off at the Castro Valley BART station since that station is closest to the cannabis store (and so that I do not have to walk through the congested and dilapidated parts like I normally have up until now). Yes, air quality is a concern I can no longer deny having. Mission Boulevard tends to be very smoggy up close because it is a main artery for (mostly petroleum powered) vehicles through the East Bay region. I will write more after I acquire the loot. See you then!</p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">If you (humans) feel insecure about yourselves, I recommend studying other animals (especially non-human apes) to gain a deeper understanding of the difference between the parts of yourself which are culturally ingrained and which parts of yourself are innate (and possibly from the same genetic programming as common mammalian ancestors).</span></p>

<p>This is a rhetorical question (which means that it does not seriously ask for an answer): is it okay for me to control my own body shape, muscle definition, hair length, clothing style, habitual patterns of locomotion and nonverbal communication, whether or not I engage in sexual intercourse or reproduction, nutritional intake, medical treatment (including &#8220;conventional&#8221; medicine and &#8220;alternative&#8221; medicine)?</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I declare myself an anarchist (which means that I believe that all forms of government are ultimately imaginary and arbitrarily imposed by each and every person). As a corollary, I declare my body to be solely owned by Nature; not by any individual person or group of persons.</span></p>

<p>Contrary to what I said earlier, I decided to spontaneously publish this note on a grassy hill next to the freeway intersections by The Three Crosses Church and Garden Of Eden (the cannabis store) BEFORE picking up my cannabis product and consuming any of it. That is because I want to be sure that I got this very important topic aired before I let the cannabis influence me. I am very proud of this page. Thank you Nature for allowing me to be Your instrument. Time to rock and roll! We shall see what art-gasms emerge (if any).</p>
