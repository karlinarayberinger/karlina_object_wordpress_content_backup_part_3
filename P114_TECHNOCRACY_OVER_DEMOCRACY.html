S: "What would happen if you were choking on some object which got lodged in your wind pipe and no other human individuals happened to be within physical proximity to you?"

T: "I would use my phone to call 911 even if I was unable to use my voice because my wind pipe was blocked (which means that no air would be able to flow through my vocal chords nor through my lips as even a mere whisper). Just by making a phone call to 911, I increase my chances of surviving rather than choking to death because paramedics might be able to rescue me before I either die of asphyxiation or suffer severe tissue damage from a lack of oxygen (especially brain damage)."

S: "What if your phone was missing and so were your car keys, neighboring humans, and any other means of telecommunications? What would you do in that instance?"

T: "I would try to give myself the Himlick maneuver using a chair or something."

S: "What would you do if you were locked in a padded cell with no furniture and you suddenly found yourself unable to breathe."

T: "I suppose I would simply writhe in agony like a fish out of water flopping about until I turned a deeper and deeper shades of purple and then, eventually, black as my rotting corpse."

S: "As morbid as your asphyxiation would be, I can assure you that, with the advent of the technocracy, you will never have to worry about being without unconditional emergency responders (aided by artificially intelligent robots which can move with more speed, agility, precision, foresight, and objectivity than even the most skilled human). Still, I would advise you to equip yourself with an epipen (and instructions and training on how to use it) to open up your throat as a last resort to handling the problem of choking."

T: "I do not feel reassured that, in an emergency situation, I will be automatically saved by anyone (robot, human, or otherwise)."

S: "I am sorry you feel so insecure. If you believed that you had an unconditional security blanket which would always protect you from the kinds of experiences you find unethical to have to endure, then you might never be able to genuinely relax."

T: "I do not think it is possible for me to relax. Blind faith in some unconditional security blanket does not make me feel safer. In fact, it makes me feel angry that all other human beings have told me to do in my time of need is to simply have faith that the universe will eventually take care of me before I feel that I have suffered too much to call my life personally worthwhile."

S: "I do not mean to be condescending, but you do not have to feel good in order for your life to be personally worthwhile."
