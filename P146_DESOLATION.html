DESOLATION

<hr>

Approximately eight years ago (back when I was enrolled in college courses, employed as a part-time Google Apps Script writer, and seemingly engaged to be married to my college sweetheart), I distinctly remember creating a YouTube video and webpage tutorial on how to translate binary numbers to decimal numbers and sharing what I created with my father at the kitchen table in my mother's house (back before my father and I were evicted by my mother to live at my father's deceased parents' house instead of my mother's house (because my mother's extramarital affair took precedence over her marriage and because I devolved into a violent and poverty-shocked criminal after all the things that gave me a sense of identity stability and self-esteem pretty much went bye-bye (and my mother wanted to get rid of me once I was no longer a guaranteed shiny piece of socioeconomic status for her to exploit))). Anyway, what I remember not being immediately disturbed by was how my father interruped me in the middle of my spiel to say something like, "You sound smart and all, but all I can concentrate on is how good you look." At that time, I was much better than I am now at suppressing my displeasure. Hence, I was able to take the incident in stride as just another example of how non-geeks are too shallow to appreciate mathematics because they are too myopically focused on posing as models for some all-important audience (because most non-geeks seemed to do little more than practice looking good in front of customers, supervisors, and coworkers in order to receive payment to exist minimally well (and my father's highest level of employment was high-school level at best, so I had patience for his lack of interest in anything other than show biz)).

Flash forward to now...I am horrified at how little I had to call family and friends throughout my entire life. Now that I have had ample time to learn how to live on my own and weather challenges without being overly dramatic and attention-whoring, I am adamant about not regressing back into the kind of social enmeshment I used to be mired in and handicapped by. I am especially horrified by how little compassion my fomer family and friends have shown me. To this day they treat my time like it is absolutely expendible and that my body only has value as a government crash test dummy. To be clear, my former friends and family of origin are too shallow, psychopathic, and dishonest for me to want to live with. That is why I have spent the last few years adapting to living in a state of partial homelessness and nightmarish destitution. My health has suffered and my lifespan is probably shorter than it would have otherwise been if I remained single, finished a college degree, and made career the most important domain of my existence. I failed to be as prescient as I "should" have been. So, according to some people, I "deserve" to suffer poverty and bodily harm as a consequence of not being more devoted to "winning" at the game of capitalism and partaking in the "requisite" cut-throat socioeconomic competitions which treat some persons as more deserving of wellness than others.

"You're smart and all, but you just gotta work harder," AJP told me with a hint of irritability in his voice while we were on our final vacation together at Yosemite National Park in the spring of 2016. His remark was in response to my confessing that I felt that I had to devote more time to building a portfolio of computer science applications to present to prospective employers. If it were that simple to get a decent job, I presumably would have done that a years ago. So why have I not yet delivered the ultimate deliverable: an employment-ready portfolio of front-end web developer project pieces? The reason I have apparently procrastinated for so long is really quite disturbing: my parents were (and still are) my biggest obstacles to me having a career and life outside the home.

Approximately three years ago (back when I spent most of my time isolated in my bedroom at my father's house), I remember my father throwing non-verbal tantrums whenever I focused intently on some computer program I was writing. I tried to make the experience as nice as possible by arranging the furniture and decor in my room to feel uplifing and motivational, listening to classical music on the radio, and taking breaks to go on walks at the nearby Lake Chabot Regional Park so that I had a sense of balance about my full-time "job" as a self-taught programmer and writer. My father's jealousy and extreme narcissism was (and probably still is) so overwhelmingly oppressive to my workflow that I basically have had no choice but to either fall ill and stay practically bedridden, career-adverse, and perpetually miserable at my parents' house(s) or else run away from home and look for other places to build my own life with as little assistance as possible. So far, I have been able to extricate myself from what looks like a deliberate setup by my parents to literally debilitate me such that I would never be able to enjoy a fulfilling career (such that I would stay hidden inside the home as some unloved, useless, and ailing disabled person who would eventually be committed to a mental institution full time). I have taken advantage of the California State University East Bay campus in Hayward as a place to work on my computer as well as places where free public electrical outlets and shelter from the wind and rain were present. At this time, I am using the $92 which the government sent me as part of my California tax refund to pay for the motel room I am housed in for just one night (which might be all I need to get some difficult blogging done with as much privacy and protection from impediments as possible).

In approximately ten days, I am required to attend court in order to deal with the felony I was convicted of last year: scraping paint off of two parked SUVs because I was pissed off at how little privacy I had and how ganged up on I felt by the people around me (and I know there is no way I can fit in with such people unless I act meek, submissive, and willing to endure endless harassment because, apparently, I am a lower class citizen than they are because I do not conform to their idea of what normalcy is: being house-bound, family-centric, petroleum-dependent, and conformist as fuck). I already served about two weeks of time in prison for such an offense and I presumably have already payed the approxiately $900 I owed (and may still owe) the person whose vehicle I superficially damaged. When I asked my mother to help me pay for that fine, she got mad at me because she wanted me to spend myself broke paying for it, yet she said that she would take care of it. Yesterday, I got a letter in the mail which said the fine has yet to be paid. So either the letter is out of date, my mother lied, or some other complication arose. If I discover that my mother indeed lied to me about paying the fine, then I presume that I will have to apply for an emergency loan (which I would not mind doing since my credit score is already below 500 and I have so little to lose that I might as well pay with my vitality...which is sort of the level I am living at now...and it is barbarism in plain sight).

My experiences have left me feeling wounded, exhausted, and shell-shocked. Even so, I have not lost my enthusiasm for the subject matter I genuinely enjoy studying because my primary motivation to keep on making my life one big self-taught college curriculum is to develop a deeper and deeper sense of appreciation for the world (and not just to impress other people and make them want to hire me for pay). The Internet has been invaluable in this regard. Online, I can most easily interact with people around the world who share my values and who share interesting works via social media. I really do not want for "in person" friends as much as I apprently "should" (according to those who think that I should literally dumb myself down on the inside to match what employers are supposedly looking for: someone who does not mind being slavishly exploited, groomed to look and feel complacently loyal to its employer and household, and content to settle for having no hobbies other than passive entertainment and socializing with people I have nothing in common with other than poverty and criminal status).

What is the purpose of this blog post? Even though I titled it DESOLATION, I wrote it in order to finalize my "divorce" from the kinds of people and culture I obviously do not jive with. Just because many (if not all) the people I have known are flippant about my existence does not mean that I have to settle for being as physically, mentally, and spiritually impoverished as they are. Just because they throw their lives away feeling sorry for themselves and waiting for Daddy Government (or whatever) to grant them more money than what they currently are accustomed to receiving (just for being old and/or disabled) does not mean I have to immitate their conduct. Instead, I critique it mercilessly and do my best to move on from living in their oppressive shadow.
