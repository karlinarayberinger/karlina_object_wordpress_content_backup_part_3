As I sit alone in the darkness of my motel room, I do my best to get my thoughts to zero in on the most urgent and important thing I could say before legitimately moving onto less emotionally provocative subject matter. 

One of the most upsetting things that could happen to me is someone destroying this treasure trove of a website (especially by deleting every trace of its existence; including whatever backups of it exist on Archive dot Org). This website is literally my best friend. It is that sentimental of an object to me. It is so much more than just a backup for my memories and a self defense tool. I poured my spirit into this entity like it is the grandest thing I intend to accomplish with my life.

If something bad happened to this website, I already know that almost no one would feel as troubled as I would and I doubt I would get much sympathy for my loss. On the contrary, I predict that at least a few people would celebrate and taunt me about how it really is not that big of a deal. "Get over yourself, stop complaining, and just be a cool like the rest of us," is what I imagine some "basic" person would sneeringly chastise me with. So when I am in pain, I almost always want to run away and hide from people because they often make my suffering worse (even while trying to be "helpful"). I just do not like being bullied and starved into forced social cohesion and feigned indifference to what I really care about (no matter how unpopular or unsavory what I care about is).

For too long I have waited for a sense of compassion and appreciation to come from the outside in. Now that I am closer than ever to my dying point (despite my idealistic longings to become immortalized through some kind of global transhumanist revolution which excludes no one), I have basically given up on waiting for other people to express unabashed and heartfelt compassion, appreciation, respect, and acceptance from other humans. Too often, I have been conditioned to believe that I have to work my ass off to get even a modicum of lukewarm goodwill from people. That is a far cry from the unconditional acceptance and gentleness I have craved ravenously for most of my life. As pathetic as this sounds to my inner scientist, my desire for unconditional love is a stronger motivation for me to pursue spirituality than is even my desire for truth...Actually, now that I am done feeling ripped apart emotionally, perhaps truth is indeed what I desire more than anything. After all, unconditional love sounds like something only a stupid infant would be obsessed with acquiring.

So if bad things happen to me (and that is probabilistically guaranteed), I will not feel embraced with love by the universe. Instead, I will feel Nature's tranquil indifference. After all I have suffered, no human kindness will ever be as selfless and as sincere as Nature's unconditionally inclusive impartiality. 

Life is not a game. Instead, it is the canvas in which games are inscribed. Humans treat each other like toys, pawns, loot, and vehicles and little else. All human affection is a desire to bolster one's own quality of life using some external object such as a person as a mere aid to that end; all while calling it love. Humans are incurable vain until and unless they evolve in a nontrivial way (and there is no guarantee that such a revolution will ever occur). I am getting ready to make my life into one long game of camping, making just enough money to get by, and being a relatively impartial observer of the world I inhabit. I am too stingy with what little seems to remain of my lifespan for me to want to squander it on non-professional relationships. I just want to deal with all humans in an impersonal and formal manner (and if that does not seem to be appropriate, I will just pretend to be some kind of goth in other people's midst).
