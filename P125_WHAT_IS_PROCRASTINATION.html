WHAT_IS_PROCRASTINATION

<hr>

Procrastination is the opposite of minding one's own business as skillfully as possible.

Attempting to micromanage other people is a form of procrastination because people (particularly humans) resent being told what to do. Resistance arises when one attempts to control something other than one's own conduct. "I am what I am. I can do whatever I want. You have to put up with me whether you like it or not," is the general attitude insecure humans (which is most humans) seem to exude (especially when such people are irritated that I appear to be happier on my own than bickering with them over territorial disputes). So rather than argue with people who play victim, play dumb, or who insist on harassing me until they get a sensationalist reaction out of me, I simply treat such persons like overgrown toddlers who just need to throw their damned tantrums and act like bullies until they get bored of such antics. Meanwhile, rather than fight with orphaned overgrown toddler ogres who act so entitled to be the center of the universe it is actually scary, I do something more proactive and empowering such as go for a walk, read, write, listen to music, or meditate.

Not too long ago, I used to eat when I was not hungry in order to numb myself out in response to being harassed by people who did not want me to relax and enjoy my solitary activities. Due to my recent stomach flu, I have been very disgusted with how much I let comparatively primitive people coerce me into being unhealthy simply because they outnumber me. I noticed that such people tend to make a living by holding uncomfortable poses for hours at a time; usually bored and passive for most of that time. Such people seem to get irritated when they see me relaxing because they think that doing mental work means looking like one is straining in an animated way like taking a hefty shit or birthing a spike ball. Such people seem to want me to look like I am in pain because they do not want to know the truth: that I am generating more value than they are simply because I am netting a much smaller harmful ecological and psychological impact than they are. In other words, whether or not my work is appreciated by other humans (and whether or not my work is rewarded with monetary payments and other material rewards), my work must be (a) intrinsically worthwhile to me, (b) done with the intent of minimizing the collective suffering, and (c) done intuitively and as autonomously as possible (rather than under some other person's micromanagement). 

The best paid job I ever had was when I worked as Google Apps Script programmer and technical writer for the Information Technology Collaborative Services department of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 01_JUNE_2012 to 30_SEPTEMBER_2015. My supervisors hardly needed to tell me what to do and they gave me and my colleagues quite a bit of time, space, and freedom to engineer software and documentation which met the requisite criteria. I enjoyed doing unit tests on the software, logging the results, and noticing patterns in how things worked. That job set the standard for what I want in my next paid job. It is work that I naturally enjoy. 

This is the crazy part: now that I am no longer willing to settle for customer service, fast food, and warehouse jobs like I used to, the lowest-paid employees within those industries are likely going to try to cripple my programming career by vandalizing my stuff, stealing my stuff, gang stalking/harassing me, and attempting to "evict" me from whatever relaxing spot I happen to be setting up my gear at. I think such people are so poisoned by their insecurity that all they are paid to do is procrastinate that they want to force me to procrastinate like they do just to "level the playing field". I want such people to stop acting like bullies and helpless victims and start taking control over their own lives. If they are not happy with their lives, then they need to identify what aspects of their lives are causing them to feel the most unhappy and do something to permanently change those aspects. Otherwise, such people are in denial that they are letting their lives become increasingly intolerable with time (and that stress is bound to spill over and adversely affect other people; causing a ripple effect of preventable strife and animosity).

Again, procrastination is not a one-size-fits-all phenomenon. Each person has a unique definition of what procrastination is because each person has a unique set of intuitive priorities (which are either honored or not).
