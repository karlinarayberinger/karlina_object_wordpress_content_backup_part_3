P: "Why are you so damned happy with yourself?"

karbytes: "I have been using an old trick for decades: thinking of my personal humanoid ego (i.e. mind) as a white male human no matter how my body appears to other human beings. <span style="background:#ffff00;">By thiking of myself as a white male human, I think of myself as someone who is never allowed to identify as a victim (and that is a wonderful thing because it means that I do not have to waste time pretending to be 'appropriately offended' by experiences which I find personally upsetting (because wallowing in prolonged distress is a waste of my precious finite attention span, opportunities, energy, and other coveted resources which are in limited supply)).</span> Instead, I think of myself as the most responsible classification of human. If I complain on my own behalf, my complaints will be ignored (by most humans) at best. If I suffer and make jokes about my suffering (rather than show signs of distress) AND always keep my focus on solving what I think are the most significant societal and personal problems, I tend to feel consistently adequate self esteem."
