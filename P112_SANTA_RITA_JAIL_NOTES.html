<p>Note: While taking a shower at this motel room (alone, of course), the following thought occurred:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I intend to kill my mother when I threw the spoon at her? At least one part of me greater than zero said yes. Therefore, the answer to that question might as well be yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the statement above is true (and I, Karlina Ray Beringer, claim it is), then I admit that I am a murderer.</p>
<p>Do I still intend to kill my mother? Not really. Like every other PERSON I ever cared about (for whatever reasons), I do not want any harm to come to it.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">To be succinct, I claim that I do not want to kill any PERSON.</span></p>

<p>PRISON_BRICKS</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The following notes were made by me between the day I was most recently arrested (and taken to Santa Rita Jail for severe vandalism) and the day immediately following my release from prison. (Basically, I got irrationally upset by how deprived of personal space my own decisions had lead me to become (and I took out my anger on rather innocent strangers by scraping marks into the exterior paint coating of two large gas guzzling automobiles which were each parked next to each other in a rather “white” and “republican” neighborhood after I felt swarmed, stalked, and silently taunted by a “gang” of control freaks while I just wanted to get home without having to entertain their apparent appetite for my suffering)).</p>
<p>Primary_Note: The main lesson I could honestly say that I derived from such trials is that it is most strategic for me to assume that people are, more likely than not, prone to escalating conflict whenever the opportunity arises because most people are bored by their myopic and destructive lives (and therefore those folks desperately crave some kind of cathartic release through the torment of some convenient scapegoat (because that is the bedrock of Christian morals (and Christian morals are what drive such folks to carelessly wreck the environment, enslave women as domestic indentured servants to patriarchal men, and coercively enforce an anthropocentric narrative which drowns out all alternative world views))). To elaborate, Jesus Christ (the central protagonist of Christian mythology) naively promoted passivity and blind faith in some anthropocentric god to the extent that he was eventually tortured and murdered (yet venerated as some kind of undead zombie and human flesh offering whose violent death somehow neutralized the brutality of humankind). Succinctly stated, the allegory of Jesus Christ dramatizes an ethic of “tit for tat” (i.e. “two wrongs make one right” or, more explicitly stated, “if you do something to make me feel transgressed against, then I am justified in doing something to make you feel transgressed against such that I feel better by way of making you feel at least as bad as I felt when you transgressed against me”). The King James Bible (which basically encapsulates the entire script behind “modern” Christian culture in America) promotes the idea that women are socially and morally obligated to contribute to society primarily by producing as many offspring as possible (while in wedlock to exactly one man) such that she helps to maximize the number of hosts to the virus of Christianity. As a consequence of producing as many offspring as possible, the Christian virus compels the human population to exceed the ecosystem’s capacity to sustain current and future human populations (such that, with each successive generation of human offspring, the quality of human life, on average (especially for the poorest humans), diminishes as a result of this environmental degradation.</p>
<p>Secondary_Note: In this journal entry (and in some of my previous journal entries on this website), I have hastily accused specific groups and individuals (within the total human population) of behaving in slovenly ways. I have been especially harshly critical of my own parents (even though I profess to “love” them unconditionally and I sincerely wish no harm on any person). In hindsight (now that I have gotten sufficient time to process my grievances), I excuse my parents (and basically everyone else) to behave as slovenly as possible because I have come to the conclusion that every person is inevitably the way it is by forces beyond its scope of awareness and ability to control. In other words, people are basically pawns in a chess game of a universe (which is deterministic and while “free will” is an illusory emergent property of deterministic forces which concur independently of human thought). The pattern of evolution of intelligent organisms (such as humans) seems to suggest that, with each successive generation of offspring, the average intelligence of the population increases. Therefore, I am logically compelled to treat my parents as less intellectually competent as I am (because the circumstances in which they were raised were not as conducive to “free thought” as the circumstances in which I was raised (and my main source of cultural programming is and was the World Wide Web (which is an emergent property of the underlying infrastructure which is the Internet))).</p>

<p>In my experience, a woman who neither wants to get married nor have kids is treated as a pest.</p>

<p>I refuse to feign helplessness and remorse. I feel lied to, stolen from, and condescended to. My Stockholm Syndrome to the police is gone. My punishments are worse than my crimes.</p>

<p>I am afraid that some are trying to maximize my time in prisons and in legitimate torture situations.</p>

<p>Jail sentences longer than 3 months for any crime are unnecessarily barbaric.</p>

<p>Artificial wombs and orphanages could end sexism by eliminating female house arrest as heteronormativity because neural computer interfaces are rehabilitative rather than simply hibernating alternatives (to the retribution that is prison).</p>

<p>Post Jail Note: In the middle of the night, my cell mate started vomiting violently brown bile and was sent home immediately. I was transferred to a different jail cell for sanitation reasons. Unfortunately, I forgot to take the pencil with me from the first cell (and, despite my requests, jail personnel refused to give me any writing instruments (because they seemingly wanted to deprive me of the “right” to write))! Hence, all notes from 21_NOVEMBER_2020 onward were hieroglyphs etched into toothpaste smeared on cardboard from menstrual pad boxes and lunch pack stiffeners.</p>

<p>My enemies cry when I am not in as much pain as they want me to be in. When I find alternatives to getting upset, they get livid. (This note was originally written while incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail for keying random cars in despair that the locals seemed to want to deprive me of privacy).</p>

<p>JAIL_NOTES: While getting my vital signs checked by a healthcare worker while incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail, I asked the person if pregnant inmates could get abortions. The answer was a curt “no”. Based on the inmate handbook I was given, pregnant inmates are forced to carry their baby to term. I suppose inmates are livestock by law.</p>

<p>“Time is more essential to value than is money. Only victims of capitalist brainwashing think of time and money as interchangeable objects of roughly equal worth. The most accurate measure of a person’s wealth is that person’s access to free time spent doing what that person most prioritizes (and hence enjoys a in a non instant gratification way).” – Immortal Mortal</p>

<p>“As soon as my prostitute comes home from wherever it is, I will silently harass it until it retreats into its designated isolation chamber (which is attached to my bedroom’s bathroom and the only indoor passage to my bedroom (and there is a sliding glass door between my bedroom and the garden)). My prostitute’s bedroom is sandwiched between my bedroom’s bathroom and the bedroom of the tenant I treat with more respect than the prostitute (because that tenant is more similar to me and more willing to conform to my preferences than that selfishly independent prostitute is). I do not want that prostitute doing anything other than diet, exercise, and rape porn. I do not care whether than prostitute is happy or not so long as I can buy my way out of being personally inconvenienced by that prostitute’s existence. I do not even care if the prostitute gets knocked unconscious, retrofitted with mind control technology, and wakes up as some demon possessed person who may or may not be aware of its overridden native ego. I just want the prostitute’s body to say words which please me and move in ways which make me feel smugly self righteous while I brag that I get what I want because I have more political power than does my prostitute. While pretending to be a rich, smart businessman, I stealthily attempt to destroy the prostitute’s momentum as a student of information technology and, instead, coerce it into focusing all of its time and energy on performing on a stage as an actor according to the dictates of law enforcement for my convenience.” – Very Important Person</p>
