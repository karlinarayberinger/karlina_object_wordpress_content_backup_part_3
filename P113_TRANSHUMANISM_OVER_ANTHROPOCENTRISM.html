<strong>PART_0: PREMISE</strong>

In order for a human being to live as well as possible in the year 2021 and beyond, that human being must adopt a worldview which includes <strong>transhumanism</strong> as an essential component of what it means for human civilization to be worth sustaining and refining. Otherwise, that human being is settling for dying as a result of <strong>"expected normalized poverty"</strong> (and, as a corollary, living in anticipation of increasing mental and physical decline as that human being increases in age).

<strong>PART_1: OBSOLESCENCE OF SEX AND DEATH</strong>

Historically speaking of homo sapiens (i.e. humans)...

Women probably suffer significantly more than men do (on average) because women have been expected (and conditioned) to give birth vaginally by default at least once (seemingly in order to earn their keep). Therefore, girls are trained from birth onward to be the designated pain absorbing half of a heterosexual couple.

As a consequence of genetic engineering (imcluding stem cell cloning, especially) and technological augmentation of the human body, sexual dimorphism between male and female humanoids can be amplified, muted, or changed.

Most notably, new human individuals can be incubated inside of artificial wombs starting as zygotes derived from stem cells whose genotypes were generated by artificial intelligence instead of the comparatively "random" process of sexual reproduction.

Humans need not reproduce sexually if human population growth regulation and genetic quality control is effectively outsourced to artificial intelligence.

Finally, given that virtually any tissue, organ, or body part can be cloned from a human's own stem cells as replacement parts, no human being is required to die of old age.

Even more notably, nanobots which can easily enter a humanoid's body via its bloodstream and such that the nanobots enter every cell in the human body, a network of nanobots can generate richly detailed information about that body and communicate with the global Internet of Things to keep that body optimally functioning.
