<strong>MULTI_DIMENSIONAL_ARRAY:</strong> an ordered sequence of elements such that each element represents a unique allocation of memory for storing exactly one piece of data and such that each element has a unique index number (i.e. nonnegative integer) within the array.

The drawing above depicts a multidimensional rather than a linear array (even though all multidimensional arrays "collapse" to linear arrays at the hardware level).
