<p>T: &#8220;Why are you not making an effort to build more intimate and numerous relationships with human beings other than yourself? Why are you not rushing to make interpersonal relationships a higher priority? Why are you not more distressed that you have zero friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I am honestly happiest alone. I am less happy when I am interacting with other humans. I have zero friends because I want to maximize my happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;There is something wrong with you if you are a human being yet you derive so little pleasure and fulfillment from socializing with other members of your species.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I disagree. I think that I am at least as mentally healthy as the humans who enjoy socializing with other humans more than I do. In fact, I daresay I am orders of magnitude happier on the inside because I have overcome what I think is one of the biggest scams throughout human evolution: the idea that human beings care about other human beings as anything more than tools to exploit for personal gratification. Because I spend significantly more time alone (and by choice) than the average human being does, I have enjoyed more opportunities to answer my own deepest philosophical questions and to research topics of interest without being told by other human beings how to make sense of things and what to focus my limited attention on.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;You are basically admitting that you cheated on whoever your friends would be by leaving them behind rather than including them in your projects even if doing so slows you down and diminishes your quality of work. <span style="background:#ffff00;">If you want to be regarded by other human beings as a good person, then you must be willing to sacrifice your personal achievement in favor of collaboration at all costs.</span> When human beings feel irrelevant to you, they tend to want you to suffer so that they can hold you ransom until you give them what they demand: your time, attention, vitality, money, affection, and leniency. You may not like that fact about human nature, but if you want to minimize your suffering, you simply must comply with what your gang stalkers want. On a spiritual level, such people are angels in disguise. They are making valiant efforts to rescue you from Satan (and Satan tends to reside in those who spend inordinate times alone rather than in the company of fellow humans).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I am not a religious person. I do not mind being perceived by other human beings as an insane or evil person. As far as spirituality is concerned, my own brand of spirituality is about discovering for oneself what is true and gratifying with as little assistance from other human beings as possible. I prefer to share my ideas through the medium of writing (particularly through the medium of a personal website). As an act of reciprocation, I read the websites of other human beings and leave comments if I think it is appropriate to do so. If people request donations for public service software and such (and if I find such entities to contribute significantly to my welfare and personal goals), I donate at least five dollars at least one time to such entities.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;I have seen you make donations to the websites which other people own and manage. What I have not seen yet is any one make an actual donation to your website.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Perhaps I need to make the PayPal donation link more prominent by placing it at top of the home page rather than at the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;I bet that you will still get zero donations even if you make that site update. That is because you have not ingratiated yourself to enough people (police included and especially). Perhaps you are not aware of how much you are supposed to feel economically crippled as retribution for crimes which you have committed. You might as well settle for doing whatever your mother says (including registering yourself as having a disabling mental illness such that you can get paid barely enough money to subsist on while you pretend you are a cripple who seriously does not mind living in the shadows of other people as someone who hardly needs to socially interact with other humans (because you apparently are not as troubled as a &#8216;normal&#8217; human would be by the prospect of being treated as functionally non existent by everyone besides yourself)).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;If I were to do my mother&#8217;s bidding (i.e. request that I be labeled as permanently mentally disabled as a cover for being financially and legally stolen from), I would be treating myself as unworthy of sustaining. I would be making myself putty in other people&#8217;s selfish hands so that other people can mold me into whatever deep fake they implicitly demand that my body-mind contorts itself into becoming. I would rather work at lowly factory jobs and daresay even customer service jobs than commit psychic suicide by falsely declaring myself handicapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;I thought you wanted a career as a software developer.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I would rather make software development a primary hobby than a source of income until I have a more secure means of income through entry-level wage jobs. Right now, seemingly no human being besides myself wants to fund my career development as a software engineer. I think most people want me to feel financially destitute and culturally impoverished and forced to socialize with people I feel are hindrances to my authentic self expression because most humans are chauvinistic and punitive by default.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;You are just not motivated enough to become a self-taught software engineer. Stop using other people as excuses to postpone your career.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;So I should just make being a dirt poor self-taught software engineer my only job?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Yes. Otherwise, you are settling for slave labor, prostitution, and demoralizing employment circumstances. I have seen you suffer immensely as a result of watching how those you were supposed to emulate as peers exuded a disturbingly low level of interest in alternative worldviews and how most of them seemed resigned to be mindless drones moving lazily and speaking in a conformist manner about uninteresting topics while you felt that you were being lobotomized just to fit into their factory of depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Thank you for the wakeup call!&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Stay woke. That&#8217;s all I can tell you. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>
