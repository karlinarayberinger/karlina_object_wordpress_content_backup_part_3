AN_ORGASM_IS_NOT_AN_OFFSPRING

In <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/two_offspring_maximum_per_womb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TWO_OFFSPRING_MAXIMUM_PER_WOMB</a>, I proposed that each human womb should yield no more than two live offspring and, as soon as possible after any particular human womb yields its second offspring, that womb should be permanently sterilized such that it can no longer incubate human zygotes (i.e. an ovum fertilized by a sperm) long enough for that zygote to develop into a <span style="background:#ffff00;">sufficiently complex" (i.e. less than a month old)</span> multicellular organism.

<span style="background:#ffff00;">What about pregnancies involving more than two offspring at one time?</span> In that case, the womb should be permitted to carry each of those offspring to term and, once each of those offspring are born, and as soon as it is safe and convenient to do so, that womb should be permanently sterilized such that it can no longer incubate human zygotes (i.e. an ovum fertilized by a sperm) long enough for that zygote to develop into a sufficiently complex multicellular organism.

I shall get to the menz part, but it a bit complicated to explain the evolutionary history of humans...

<span style="background:#ffff00;">Historically speaking, male humans have been enabled by their physiology to propagate their gametes faster than female humans have. Also, male humans have been enabled by their physiology to invest significantly fewer resources in the process of sexual reproduction than female humans have.</span> The evolutionary inequality I am writing about in today's article is reflected in my "naturalistic bias" in yesterday's article (and yesterday's article is about setting a hard limit for the number of offspring each individual female-bodied human "should" generate (if the goal of the human species is to survive and become interplanetary beings allowed to evolve indefinitely rather than go extinct due to overpopulation within too small of a window of space and time to reverse that "downward spiral")).

Before I continue unraveling my "doubly secure" plan to help the human species quickly (and cheaply) mitigate and permantly resolve the crisis of <span style="background:#ffff00;">overpopulation (which I think is the root cause of systemic poverty, violent territorial disputes, and delayed scientific and cultural progress)</span>, I would like to share some "technical definitions" which I personally find interesting as a biology nerd to think about...

<strong>haploid:</strong> a specialized cell within a multicellular organism which contains only half the genome of its constituent multicellular organism.

<strong>diploid:</strong> a cell within either a single-celled organism (i.e. prokaryote) or else a multi-cellular organism (i.e. eukaryote) which contains the entire genome of its constituent organism. 

<strong>gamete:</strong> a haploid designed to transfer half the genome of its originating multicellular organism to exactly one complementary haploid such that a synthesis of exactly two half-genomes of the same species can be produced in an offspring of that species.

<strong>sperm:</strong> a haploid which only male humans produce (in organs known as testes (and testes have the same evolutionary origin as ovaries)). <span style="background:#ffff00;">Note: a sperm is significantly cheaper to produce than is an egg. Also, one organism can typically produce functional sperm across its entire adult lifespan (even in old age).</span>

<strong>ovum:</strong> a haploid which only female humans produce (in organs known as ovaries (and ovaries have the same evolutionary origin as testes)). <span style="background:#ffff00;">Note: an ovum is significantly more costly to produce than is a sperm. Presumably for that reason, female humans historically have a limited window of fertility (in terms of montly ovulation cycles and in terms of age range of fertility).</span>

<strong>chromosome:</strong> a sub-cellular structure which is transferred from one organism to another via the propagation of gametes which contains the 4-digit encoded blueprint for implementing some specific set of features in the organism that genetic code is designed to instantiate.

<strong>genotype:</strong> the complete collection of genetic instructions required to instantiate exactly one organism.

<strong>phenotype:</strong> the implementation of a particular genotype as a living organism.

<strong>zygote:</strong> a diploid which is the synthesis of two complementary haploids (particularly one ovum and one sperm).


(specifically haploids (which are cells that contain only half of the constituent organism's genome)) in the form of sperm cells (i.e. mobile capsules which compete against each other to fertilize an ovum (i.e. egg cell (which is also a haploid) of the same species)
