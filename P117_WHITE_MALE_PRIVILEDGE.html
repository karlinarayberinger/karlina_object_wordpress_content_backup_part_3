WHITE_MALE_PRIVILEDGE

P: "Why are you so damned happy with yourself?"

karbytes: "I have been using an old trick for decades: thinking of my personal humanoid ego (i.e. mind) as a white male human no matter how my body appears to other human beings (and no matter how other human beings assume my actual mind is configured). By thiking of myself as a white male, I do not think of myself as a victim. Instead, I think of myself as the most responsible classification of human. If I complain on my own behalf, my complaints will be ignored (by most humans) at best. If I suffer and make jokes about my suffering (rather than show signs of distress) AND always keep my focus on solving what I think are the most significant societal and personal problems, I tend to feel consistently adequate self esteem."
