<p>As I was walking from Castro Valley BART station towards Hayward (to get to California State University East Bay) along A Street, I could not help but notice a wordless sense of unease, cynicism, and antiquity in the clues from the environment. The closer I got to downtown Hayward, the thicker the claustrophobic &#8220;ether&#8221; started to feel to me. Once I got to the intersection of Second Street and A Street, I felt an overwhelming sense of morbid impatience to hurry up, mate, lay eggs, and die. I imagined having to sneak onto campus like an unwelcome coyote amongst sweet little fuck bunnies. I remembered the pain of being (metaphorically) kicked about like a soccer ball by campus police after one of the pit-bull monkey men felt threatened by my gender nonconformity and liberty of movement (since many of the guys there look like pent-up overgrown little boys whose balls have yet to drop and many of the girls there look like brainwashed Bratz dolls raised to be whores who cannot lift a finger without some patriarch&#8217;s command to move according to His whims). I envisioned blackness engulfing me and digesting me like I was nothing more than a Eucharist for Catholic vampires to callously devour. My gut tightened with dread. My throat tightened with stifled cries of agony. It was enough to make me turn around and walk back to the Castro Valley BART station to ride the train back to the more breathable Dublin/Pleasanton area. As I walked, I could not help but decide that I am never going back to California State University East Bay again because it is overpriced and sleazy (and Chabot-Las Positas Community College was significantly more affordable and the quality of my student experience there was noticeably higher). I think Hayward is a cesspool of stubborn refusal to modernize. All the cities around it would likely have to radically modernize before Hayward would be compelled to stop being such a damned ghetto and start being part of the modern world. I want to turn my back on the city that treats the ecosystem like The Giving Tree (i.e. that Earth is an infinitely patient and self-sacrificing maternal figure that would allow itself to be decimated by greedy and reckless apes who act like thug toddler kings whose entitlement reeks across the globe). Good bye savage wasteland dump of destitution, prostitution, and chauvinism as godliness. I would rather be a &#8220;military monk&#8221; in the competitively peaceful plains of Dublin and make an honest living as a researcher and developer; not a baby whore cock sucker.</p>
