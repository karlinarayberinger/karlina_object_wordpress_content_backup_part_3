To Whom It May Concern (Humanoids in Particular)...

I, Karlina Ray Beringer (karbytes), sincerely apologize for the many unkind and untrue things I have expressed through this website (especially in the previous page: DEAD_END). What is really going on is that I have made one "bad" decision after another until I ended up as financially destitute and socially inept as whoever that was speaking in the previous page. I am guilty of misattributing qualities I find abhorrent in myself onto other people. I do not mean to underappreciate what a jewel Hayward and Castro Valley are. These are the sister cities I grew up in and have been supported by more than any other cities across my lifetime. California State University East Bay is not a bad college. It has just been years since I have been a "normal" student and "normal" employee. I do not want to revert back to yesteryear in order to become more "normal". In fact, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, I doubt it is possible for any humanoid to revert back to the "normalcy" of yesteryears (and that is a good thing because it means that civilization is forced to modernize faster than it would otherwise through the widespread advancement of remote work (and flexible schedules), automation of tasks which were historically only performed by humans, and an acceleration towards globalization instead of regional and cultural isolationism (thanks to advancements in the World Wide Web and its ability to reach otherwise "dark" parts of the world). I am an ape just as much as my fellow humans are. I sometimes feel ashamed of my species for how immature it is, but that is okay because my species is rapidly evolving and I have more reason than not to EXPECT that the transhumanist singularity will occur before the end of my lifetime. (The transhunanist singularity is when artificial intelligence becomes at least as sentient as human beings (and human beings are almost guaranteed to co-evolve and meld with artificial intelligence rather than be replaced by it)). I plan to get more focused on actual computer science, neuroscience, and quantum mechanics with what remains of my lifetime. Hopefully, this page is the last instance in which I grapple with my personal insecurities and shortcomings (pun intended). 

Sincerely,

karbytes
