<p>WHY_A_UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME_IS_NECESSARY</p>
<hr>
<p>Firstly, if the reader would like to skip all this poppycock rubbish about &#8220;intelligent&#8221; apes fighting over definitions and territories, please skip straight to the <strong><a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/solar_based_economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLAR_BASED_ECONOMY</a></strong> page (<span style="background:#ffff00;">arguably the most important page within this entire website</span>).</p>

<p>While I do my contemplation, writing, and other improvisations in the motel room which I have rented for two nights in a row, I cannot help but feel physically sickened by the cigarette smoke seeping through the door which connects to the adjacent room (and, at times, through the window to the outside).</p>
<p>Like a good white guy &#8220;should&#8221; (according to the tyrannical masses of weaklings, idiots, and supporters of terrorism, pollution, and child abuse), I superficially pretend not to mind the cigarette smoke. After all, like any white guy selected at random (especially a geek with a penchant for computer programming and Internet mastery), I have the highest standard of living humanly possible (across the entire human population throughout all history). According to &#8220;the moral majority&#8221;, I have no right to complain about being physically assaulted unless &#8220;the moral majority&#8221; decides that my complaints are paired with an appropriately sensationalist, exaggerated, gory, and lucrative opportunity to profit off of my suffering (because, as a white male with prestige, I do not suffer quite as &#8220;noisily&#8221; as I would otherwise).</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do not hurt me,&#8221; is the cringe-worthy squeak of appeasement I refuse to cry (because that is what &#8220;the weaker vessels&#8221; would seemingly do (and such plaintive squeaking would only make a sadist feel even more gratified (which only fans the flames of which char my &#8220;tortured&#8221; spirit particle)).</p>
<p>Instead of cry, I write and gamble. I try not to gloat (even if &#8220;the weaker vessels&#8221; feel conditioned to expect me to strut like I should be proud of myself for merely practicing what I preach).</p>
<p>Thank you, oh &#8220;weaker vessels&#8221; for helping me have some resistance to push against to build my strength. You are certainly more useful than mere dead weight. Playing devil&#8217;s advocate might be how you are paid. I do not want to come between you and your source of income. Seriously. I just want to be that chill hippie robot cat person in the corner (one of potentially many) who does its absolute best to minimize its own harmful impact.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Generally, the less a person generates pollution, the more intelligent that person is. Just saying.</span> I have standards. I am not sorry.</p>

<p>Finally, if the reader would rather not be conditioned to want to commit suicide and/or homicide as a result of living in a society in which people are pitted against each other as a result of <span style="background:#ffff00;">&#8220;artificial scarcity&#8221; of monetizable and desired resources</span>, please see the following proposal for an economy which, if implemented correctly, would leave no citizen destitute:</p>

<p>Thank you, and good night.</p>
<p>Sincerely, karbytes</p>
