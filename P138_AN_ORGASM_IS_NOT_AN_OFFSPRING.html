AN_ORGASM_IS_NOT_AN_OFFSPRING

<hr>

In X, I proposed that each human womb should yield no more than two live offspring and, as soon as possible after any particular human womb yields its second offspring, that womb should be permanently sterilized such that it can no longer incubate human zygotes (i.e. an ovum fertilized by a sperm) long enough for that zygote to develop into a <span style="background:#ffff00;">sufficiently complex" (i.e. less than a month old)</span> multicellular organism.

<span style="background:#ffff00;">What about pregnancies involving more than two offspring at one time?</span> In that case, the womb should be permitted to carry each of those offspring to term and, once each of those offspring are born, and as soon as it is safe and convenient to do so, that womb should be permanently sterilized such that it can no longer incubate human zygotes (i.e. an ovum fertilized by a sperm) long enough for that zygote to develop into a sufficiently complex multicellular organism.

I shall get to the menz part, but it a bit complicated to explain the evolutionary history of humans...
