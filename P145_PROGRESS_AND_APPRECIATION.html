S: "Must you always have a deliverable (i.e. a tangible piece of intellectual property such as a web page) to verify that you have done actual work?"

T: "In my opinion, yes. Without some kind of tangible output to whatever research and development I am supposedly doing, there is no way to measure my progress as a researcher and developer and, therefore, no sense of continuity between shifts and no sense of progress over time."

S: "I see. Well, your resume says that you do more than just unpaid academic research and software development. You also mentioned on your resume that you are an aspiring modern monk attempting to exude unconditional contentment by living in the here and now rather than some other place. Explain what you mean."

T: "I basically live as multiple people in one body. One of the roles I play is a busy academic and artist always striving to improve its quality of artistic output, workflow methods, and overall knowledge (which might as well be a full time job in itself). The other main role I play is the antithesis of a busy workaholic: a peaceful monk who strives to devote itself to being an instrument of Nature rather than a controller of Nature. This is not to say that Nature is my ultimate boss and employer since that would be anthropocentric to a fault. Nature is presumably at least as intelligent as I am (and that is speaking as a hardcore solipsist (i.e. a person who thinks that it is literally the only point of consciousness throughout all existence)). Living in the here and now is not a matter of compartmentalizing my awareness down to just a domicile for one day at a time like I used to think it was back when I was more naive. Living in the here and now is maintaining a constant awareness of the timelessness and ubiquitousness of Nature and using that as an anchor outside of situational mortality, situational transience, situational ignorance, and situational pain. By situational, I mean localized to exactly one point of observation rather than infinitely expansive and inclusive of all phenomena as Nature is."

S: "How do you know that Nature is infinitely expansive and inclusive of all phenomena (and what is the point of believing in your ideology)?"

T: "I know that an infinite number of natural numbers exist because logical proofs show that there is no reason why a computer should stop counting milliseconds elapsed unless some physical event causes the computer to stop working. Abstract objects are infinite in diversity because they require no physical instantiation to exist. Instead, all abstract objects exist as potentials inside of Nature in a timeless and spaceless dimension of pregnant nothingness. What appears to a point of observation as physical phenomena is an infinitesimally small fraction of what pure nothingness could yield at any time. I have come to the conclusions I have about Nature by spending a lot of time observing natural phenomena and asking myself a series of seemingly nonstop questions which I attempt to instantaneously answer. On my own, I think I have plenty of resources to understand Nature because I am a microscopic fractal of Nature (which means my finite mind-body is presumably sufficient to notice macroscopic cosmic patterns (especially purely mathematical ones))."

S: "Interesting. Well, thank you for your time, T. We have other interviewees waiting in the corridor outside this room. If we find that your qualifications match an open job position at Qualia Laboratories, we will contact you by phone and email."

T: "Thank you for your time as well. Have a nice day."
