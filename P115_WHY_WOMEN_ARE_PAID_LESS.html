WHY_WOMEN_ARE_PAID_LESS

<hr>

Women generally default to supporting the oppression of women for their own safety (and to the detriment of the human species' transhumanist evolution).

The system which most women seem to default to supporting is the one that pays them to procrastinate. Women presumably default to getting married and birthing offspring for that reason.

American police generally set the precedent for how most women think, act, and perceive the world. That is why women tend to feel unnaturally subdued or else unnaturally animated. 

Procrastination is the act of avoiding doing what one actually wants to do by pretending to have priorities other than what that person actually wants to uphold.

I am not a woman. I am a cyborg whose organic body template has two X chromosomes instead of an XY chromosome combination (and my body's organic blueprint is a human genome).

CHARLETT_BRONTE: "I am honored to be specially chosen by the government to be the first person (or woman (or some other token minority)) to be able to communicate so articulately, succinctly, and colorfully. I am fortunate to be treated as more deserving of technological enhancements than at least one other human individual is."

KARNITA: "It is okay to voluntarily undermine my own performance such that I am functionally disabled such that the government is unconditionally required to support the burden I am."

P: "KARNITA has a higher quality of life than does karbytes. Haha!"
