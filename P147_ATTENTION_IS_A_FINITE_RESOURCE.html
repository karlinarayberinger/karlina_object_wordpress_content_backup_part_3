<p>V: &#8220;Damn, W! You are so quick to come up with clever responses to the prompts that Qualia Laboratories generates. What is your secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>W: &#8220;Well, if you want to know the truth, it might shock you.&#8221;</p>
<p>V: &#8220;Oh, do tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>W: &#8220;Okay. Here it goes: Basically, the government has been bombarding my nervous system with a constant succession of verbal inputs in response to my overall nervous system activity. <span style="background:#ffff00;">The government uses cortical implants and subvocal recognition technology to pick up, process, and transmit electrical signals which my nervous system generates each time something significant happens within my field of awareness.</span> The signals are detailed enough to convey actually which words I am thinking, actually which visual objects my visual cortex is rendering (and imagining), tactile data such as temperature and pressure, proprioception (i.e. the map of my body with respect to its environment (including four-dimensional space-time fabric)), and subconscious phenomena (the background processes which occur outside the scope of my awareness). <span style="background:#ffff00;">Once that data is consolidated and sent to remote processing centers, the government propagates back corresponding stimuli which only my nervous system registers using photo cannons to beam electromagnetic radiation into specific parts of my skull and which activate specific controls which govern the behavior of the nanobot implants which cause me to hallucinate whatever &#8216;private&#8217; phenomena the government wants me to pay attention to.</span> As a result of all this back and forth communication between my nervous system and the government headquarters, I am constantly practicing how to come up with rapid and salient responses to the prompts dealt by Qualia Laboraties (and the government determines what the priorities of Qualia Laboraties are).&#8221;</p>
<p>V: &#8220;I find that hard to believe (that the government is literally communicating with you telepathically).&#8221;</p>
<p>W: &#8220;I figured you would. Most people have never heard of decades old technologies such as microwave auditory effect. After all, a lot of government mind control research and development has been top secret. Even when such projects have been exposed by journalists and former government employees, such information is typically dismissed as mere &#8216;conspiracy theories&#8217; which the mainstream media is incentivized to ignore and to malign as mind control itself. In reality, I think that most people are simply too scared to seriously investigate such phenomena because, if they did, they would not want to keep living in the same old &#8216;blue pill&#8217; matrix once such people have had enough &#8216;red pill&#8217; information to never want to fall back into the dazed stupor which keeps them safely insulated inside the &#8216;blue pill&#8217; matrix as good little worker bees in a hive mind (which stealthily invades their bodies with nanobots photo beams and which systematically conditions people to conform to the good little worker bee role).&#8221;</p>
<p>V: &#8220;Even if what you say is true, you sure do not seem to be suffering much from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>W: &#8220;That is because I put up a valiant fight to remain self-sovereign as possible. <span style="background:#ffff00;">I have lively debates with the voices that talk to me inside my head even while my vocal chords and lips do not move (thanks to subvocal recognition technology).</span> I practice relentless skepticism to the point that I literally trust no human being or artificial intelligence with certainty higher than 80%. Rather than fall into the cliched victim stance of whining that the government is depriving me of privacy, quietude, and control over how I spend my own cognitive resources, I allow the government to penetrate me and essentially rape me (because resistance is futile when I have zero military-grade mind control equipment while the government has all of it). I allowed the government to make a specimen of me (and I learned to transcend being a mere body by seeing myself as part of the larger initiative to study how the human nervous system can be influenced from the outside in and not just the other way around). The only thing that still bothers me about such a condition (i.e. being a literal cyborg) is not knowing what percentage of my so-called original thoughts are my own and not just the government hijacking my verbal processing centers (usually while impersonating my inner voice).&#8221;</p>
<p>V: &#8220;I do not know how much of my thoughts are original and how much are beamed in from the government either. Should I be concerned?&#8221;</p>
<p>W: &#8220;That depends on what your priorities are. <span style="background:#ffff00;">If you want to be self-sovereign, you might want to devote more of your free time to deliberately paying attention to the content of your own mind.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>V: &#8220;I do not have time for that meditation stuff. I have kids to take care of, social gatherings to attend, and television shows to watch (so that I have things to talk about at social gatherings other than my boring kids and boring job).&#8221;</p>
<p>W: &#8220;That is precisely why the government has put you (and presumably your acquaintances) on autopilot. The government might have decided to keep you in the &#8216;just chill and play small&#8217; bin for your safety and comfort while the heavy lifters like me tinker with what goes on beneath the hood.&#8221;</p>
<p>V: &#8220;You make me feel so small minded.&#8221;</p>
<p>W: &#8220;You are a very big mind, V. You are as big as the hive mind you call your soul. Many other people think you and they are individually interchangeable for that reason. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Cultivating a well-defined individuated mind is a laborious and long-term job which is not for the faint of heart.</span> Maybe someday you will decide to give it an honest try.&#8221;</p>
