<p>My <strong>enemies</strong> are persons who apparently enjoy my suffering and who deliberately attempt to induce a significant portion of my future suffering.</p>
<p>I do believe that the adage, <strong>&#8220;friends are known enemies&#8221;</strong>, is generally applicable to each and every human-to-human relationship.</p>
<p>Some people genuinely want to alleviate the collective suffering of human civilization. Such a feat is functionally invalid unless absolutely zero individual persons are excluded from exactly one person&#8217;s intention to alleviate the collective suffering of human civilization.</p>
